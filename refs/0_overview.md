# Principles of Product-Market Fit (PMF) for AI/LLM SaaS Products  
_Overview for overview.md (2024–2025 best practices)_

The main takeaway: The AI products with the strongest product‑market fit in 2024–2025 (Cursor, Claude Code, Runway, Pika, HeyGen, Harvey, PhotoRoom, Writer, Canva, Figma, Notion, etc.) all treat AI as an engine for a very specific, high‑value workflow—not as “magic dust.” They win PMF by obsessively narrowing their use case, deeply integrating into existing tools and habits, and then iterating ruthlessly using data, user feedback, and community.

Below is a structured overview you can use directly as an `overview.md`.

***

## 1. What Product‑Market Fit Means Now (Especially for AI SaaS)

Classic PMF definition:  
People in a clearly defined segment love your product, use it frequently, pay for it willingly, and recommend it, such that growth comes increasingly from word of mouth rather than pushy sales.

For AI/LLM and agentic SaaS in 2024–2025, PMF has some specific traits:

- The product solves a single, painful, repetitive workflow (not “do everything with AI”).  
- Users integrate it into their daily or weekly routine (e.g., Cursor for coding, Claude Code for refactors, Runway/Pika for video, PhotoRoom for product photos, Harvey for legal workflows).  
- Users trust the results (safety, accuracy, control) enough to rely on them in production or professional work.  
- The value is clearly measurable: time saved, money saved, or revenue unlocked (e.g., fewer hours drafting contracts, faster storyboarding, more content shipped).  
- The AI is invisible as “tech” and visible as “new superpower” in an existing job.

PMF is not just “people say they like it” or “cool demos on social media.” It is sustained, compounding usage and revenue from a clearly understood core job‑to‑be‑done.

***

## 2. Core PMF Principles (Abstracted from Top AI Products)

### 2.1 Start with a Narrow, High‑Value Job‑to‑Be‑Done

Successful AI products start narrow:

- Cursor: “Make writing and editing code inside your editor radically faster.”  
- Claude Code and Devin‑style tools: “Handle well‑scoped coding tasks end‑to‑end, not just snippets.”  
- Runway, Pika: “Let creators generate and edit high‑quality video from text or lightweight inputs.”  
- HeyGen: “Produce talking‑head videos and avatars for content and localization, at scale.”  
- Harvey: “Draft, review, and analyze legal documents with reliable, firm‑specific knowledge.”  
- PhotoRoom: “Create studio‑quality product photos for sellers without a designer or studio.”  
- Canva/Figma/Notion: “Make design/collaboration/docs easy for non‑experts, with AI as accelerator.”

Principle:  
- Pick a painful, frequent, expensive workflow for a well‑defined user, then design everything (UI, prompts, integrations, pricing) around that.

### 2.2 AI‑Native, Not AI‑Added

The strongest PMF stories are “AI‑native” products, not bolt‑ons:

- Cursor is a code editor whose primary interface is AI chat + code suggestions, not a plugin bolted onto an old UX.  
- Runway and Pika are built around generative video as the core, not as a “filter” in a traditional editor.  
- Canva, Notion, Figma, Writer, PhotoRoom weave AI deeply into core flows (generate first draft, suggest design, reformat content) instead of making AI a side panel.

Principle:

- The user’s main action is “tell the system what they want” (intent) and “edit/refine,” not manually doing everything.  
- The product model: “AI produces, user edits,” not “user produces, AI decorates.”

### 2.3 Opinionated Workflows, Not Open‑Ended Chat

Open‑ended chat feels powerful but usually has weak PMF. Winners build:

- Opinionated flows: templates, modes, task‑specific assistants (draft contract, storyboard, refactor file, fix test).  
- Structured input and output: forms, constraints, guardrails, reusable prompts.  
- One‑click defaults: “Remove background,” “Extend scene,” “Translate and dub,” “Refactor with tests.”

Principle:

- AI should feel like a set of powerful, specific tools, not a blank canvas requiring the user to think in prompts.

### 2.4 Reliability, Control, and Safety as Product Features

Professional users (developers, lawyers, designers, enterprises) need trust:

- Deterministic controls (settings for creativity, style, temperature).  
- Versioning, history, and undo.  
- Source of truth: knowledge bases, firm‑specific policies (Harvey, Writer).  
- Privacy and security: on‑premise, private models, data controls, SOC2, etc.  
- Human‑in‑the‑loop: workflows where humans approve drafts before they matter.

Principle:

- “Trust and control” is part of PMF. Without it, AI is perceived as a toy.

### 2.5 Extreme Focus on Speed and UX

AI‑heavy products have inherent latency and complexity. Strong PMF products:

- Optimize for snappy feedback (progress indicators, streaming outputs, incremental previews).  
- Offer smart defaults so a new user can succeed in 1–3 clicks/keystrokes.  
- Provide “fast paths” for power users (keyboard shortcuts, batch operations, API).

Principle:

- Latency and friction kill PMF. Make the “happy path” to value incredibly fast.

### 2.6 Community and Distribution Loops

The most successful AI products pair PMF with viral or community‑driven distribution:

- Developer tools (Cursor, Claude Code, Devin‑style) leverage GitHub, VS Code ecosystems, and dev Twitter/X.  
- Creative tools (Runway, Pika, HeyGen, PhotoRoom, Canva) thrive on social sharing: every output is a mini‑ad.  
- Knowledge tools (Notion, Writer) spread via teams sharing documents and templates.

Principle:

- Design the product so usage naturally creates shareable artifacts or invites others in.  
- Community doubles as “research” and “support” for PMF, not just marketing.

***

## 3. Modern PMF Signals and Metrics for AI SaaS

In 2024–2025, PMF measurement mixes classic SaaS metrics with AI‑specific ones.

Key behavioral signals:

- High weekly and monthly active usage for core flows (not just signups).  
- Strong retention curves: cohorts flatten rather than drop toward zero.  
- Deep workflow integration: users keep the app open all day, or it runs as a core agent in their tools.  
- Strong expansion: users upgrade to higher tiers or add more seats/usage.

Qualitative signals:

- Users proactively describe the product as “indispensable,” “magic,” or “I can’t go back.”  
- Clear, consistent description of value from users (“saves me hours per week,” “replaced a junior role,” “I deliver more content now”).  
- Users defend the product in public discussions and communities.

AI‑specific metrics:

- Task completion rate: percentage of tasks where AI generates usable output with minimal edits.  
- Human‑edit distance: how much users need to change the AI’s output before accepting.  
- Prompt‑to‑output success time: time from request to acceptable output.  
- Agent autonomy rate (for agentic tools): % of tasks completed without human intervention beyond initial specification.

***

## 4. Planning for PMF: Strategy, Stages, and Questions

### 4.1 PMF Stage 0: Choose the Right Problem and Segment

Goals:

- Identify a narrow, high‑value problem and a specific user persona.  
- Validate that the problem is urgent, frequent, and budgets exist to solve it.

Planning tasks:

- Define 1–2 target personas (e.g., “freelance video editor,” “mid‑market e‑com brand owner,” “senior backend engineer,” “M&A associate”).  
- Map their main workflows and pains using interviews and shadowing.  
- Articulate 1–2 key jobs‑to‑be‑done: “Ship client product images,” “Draft NDAs,” “Refactor legacy services,” “Storyboard TikTok campaigns.”  
- Benchmark what they use today (Canva, Figma, existing IDEs, manual processes, agencies).

Key questions:

- Is the problem painful enough that they will switch tools or change behavior?  
- How often does this job occur (daily/weekly vs once per quarter)?  
- What does “10x better” look like for them?

### 4.2 PMF Stage 1: Build a Thin, AI‑Native Prototype

Goals:

- Create a minimal but complete workflow that delivers real value once a user gets through it.

Planning tasks:

- Choose a single “hero flow” that starts with user intent and ends with a finished artifact.  
  - Example: “Upload product photo → remove background → auto‑generate product‑ready template → export.”  
  - Example: “Open repo → describe feature → AI drafts changes → run tests → user approves.”  
- Decide what parts are AI vs deterministic logic vs manual steps.  
- Design narrow UX around this hero flow (not a full platform).  
- Implement guardrails: constraints, validation, safe defaults, clear error handling.  
- Integrate into the tool users already live in (browser, IDE, Figma, Notion, Slack).

Key questions:

- Can a new user get to a “wow” moment in under 3–10 minutes?  
- Does the workflow feel like “magic with control,” not chaos?

### 4.3 PMF Stage 2: Validate with Real Users in a Tight Loop

Goals:

- Quickly iterate based on real usage, not hypothetical feedback.

Planning tasks:

- Recruit 10–50 “design partners” or early adopters in your exact target segment.  
- Run usage‑based interviews: watch them use the tool on their real work.  
- Ship weekly improvements based on observed friction: prompts, instructions, defaults, UI changes.  
- Instrument the product to track the hero flow end to end.

Useful metrics at this stage:

- Number of users who reach the “wow” moment (completed hero flow) per week.  
- Time to first value (TTFV) from signup to first successful completion.  
- Repeat usage on core flow within 7 days and 30 days.  
- Net promoter‑style questions: “How disappointed would you be if you could no longer use this?” (Sean Ellis test).

Key questions:

- What are users doing before and after your tool?  
- What manual work is still left? What would they pay more to automate?  
- Where does the AI fail most often, and how can you reduce that failure or surface it better?

### 4.4 PMF Stage 3: Deepen the Workflow, Not Just Add Features

Goal:

- Once initial PMF is evident for one use case, deepen that use case instead of immediately expanding sideways.

Planning tasks:

- Identify the highest‑value, highest‑frequency sub‑tasks in the core flow and improve them.  
  - E.g., for a coding agent: multi‑file refactors, context handling, test generation.  
  - For a creative tool: better control over style, camera moves, brands, templates.  
  - For a legal agent: citation accuracy, clause libraries, firm‑specific standards.  
- Improve reliability and predictability before adding more “modes” or “models.”  
- Add collaboration features where natural (comments, sharing, handoff).

Key questions:

- What would make a current power user say “I spend 50% of this workflow inside your product”?  
- Where are users still switching back to their old tools?

### 4.5 PMF Stage 4: Pricing, Packaging, and Expansion

Once there is strong engagement and user love, refine business model:

Planning tasks:

- Align pricing with value:  
  - Seat‑based for team tools (Figma, Notion, Writer).  
  - Usage‑based for content/compute‑heavy tools (Runway, Pika, HeyGen).  
  - Tiered plans with key unlocks (API access, advanced controls, collaboration, higher limits).  
- Define clear upgrade triggers (e.g., more projects, more seats, more minutes, more repos).  
- Introduce higher‑touch features for bigger customers (SSO, custom models, data residency).

Key questions:

- What do power users say is “worth paying a lot more for”?  
- Which features must be in free/low tier to enable growth and community, and which belong in pro/enterprise?

***

## 5. Tasking: How to Work Day‑to‑Day Toward PMF

This section translates principles into concrete tasks and rituals.

### 5.1 Weekly PMF Operating Rhythm

- Talk to users every week  
  - 3–5 qualitative calls or live sessions with target users.  
  - Focus: what they did, where they got stuck, what they hacked around your product.

- Ship small improvements every week  
  - Treat UX, defaults, and prompt engineering as critical features.  
  - Prioritize: removing friction in the hero flow over adding new flows.

- Review metrics weekly  
  - Core funnel: signup → first project/task → first successful output → repeat use.  
  - Retention curves: 1‑day, 7‑day, 30‑day active usage.  
  - AI‑specific metrics: completion rate, edit distance, latency.

- Community and support  
  - Watch communities (Discord, Slack, Twitter/X, forums) for organic feedback.  
  - Turn recurring user hacks into first‑class product features or templates.

### 5.2 Role‑Level Tasking

To reach PMF, the team structure and responsibilities often look like:

- Product  
  - Owns the definition of the hero workflows and target personas.  
  - Constantly refines the “10x better than alternative” narrative.  
  - Partners with users to co‑design new flows.

- Engineering / ML  
  - Makes the AI more reliable, controllable, and fast.  
  - Builds observability: logs, traces, and metrics at the task level.  
  - Works on fallback strategies when models fail.

- Design  
  - Crafts interfaces that hide complexity and guide users to successful outcomes.  
  - Iterates on templates and presets that encode best practices.  
  - Designs clarity around uncertainty (e.g., confidence indicators, warnings).

- GTM / Growth  
  - Builds onboarding sequences and educational content tailored to each persona.  
  - Uses product data to identify promising segments and refine positioning.  
  - Runs experiments on pricing, messaging, and landing pages.

***

## 6. Patterns from Leading AI/LLM Products

Condensed patterns you can copy:

- Single clear wedge use case  
  - PhotoRoom: background removal and product images first, not “full Photoshop replacement.”  
  - Runway/Pika: text‑to‑video and video editing; showreels and social outputs create virality.  
  - Harvey: focus on specific legal tasks (drafting, reviewing) for specific practice areas.

- Deep ecosystem integration  
  - Developer tools: integrate into IDEs, GitHub, CI pipelines.  
  - Creative tools: plugins for Adobe, Figma, social platforms.  
  - Knowledge tools: APIs and connectors to internal docs, CRM, ticketing, etc.

- Guardrailed power  
  - Simple default flows that “just work” for common tasks.  
  - Advanced controls for power users, but not exposed by default.

- Community as force multiplier  
  - Public templates, workflows, and showcases (Canva, Figma, Notion).  
  - Leaderboards, galleries, shared prompts, or preset libraries.  
  - Early‑user programs and closed betas for new features.

***

## 7. Checklist: Designing an AI Product for PMF in 2024–2025

Use this as a practical checklist when planning your own AI/agent product:

- Problem and user  
  - Is there exactly one core persona?  
  - Is there exactly one core job‑to‑be‑done that is: painful, frequent, and budgeted?

- Workflow  
  - Is there one “hero flow” that gets a user from intent to finished artifact in minutes?  
  - Can a brand‑new user reach a “wow” moment quickly?

- AI usage  
  - Does AI handle the most tedious or complex steps, not trivial ones?  
  - Are there clear guardrails and controls for users to correct the AI?

- UX and speed  
  - Is the main interface tailored to the workflow (not generic chat)?  
  - Is latency acceptable, with good feedback and streaming where needed?

- Trust and reliability  
  - Can users verify or correct outputs easily?  
  - Are privacy and safety handled in a way that’s obvious and reassuring?

- Metrics and iteration  
  - Are you measuring usage at the task/workflow level?  
  - Do you have weekly user conversations and shipping cadence?

- Distribution and expansion  
  - Does the product naturally create content or artifacts that users share?  
  - Are there natural paths from single‑user utility to team or org‑wide adoption?

Below is a distilled “playbook” of how top AI / LLM-native products and iconic SaaS tools actually get to strong product-market fit (PMF), with concrete patterns you can apply to your own AI SaaS / agent product.

***

## 1. How PMF for AI SaaS is Different

For AI/LLM products, PMF is less about “I have a chatbot” and more about:

1. **Embedding AI inside a high-frequency workflow**  
   - Cursor, Claude Code, Lovable.dev → *coding loop*  
   - Harvey → *legal research / drafting loop*  
   - Canva, Figma, Notion → *creation + collaboration loop*  

2. **Owning a full job-to-be-done (JTBD), not a feature**  
   - Devin pitches “AI software engineer”, not “code completion”.  
   - HeyGen, Pika, Runway → “make a finished video for X use case”, not just “generate clips”.  
   - Writer.ai, Photoroom → “produce publish-ready content/assets that meet brand constraints”.

3. **Delivering a step‑change outcome, not a marginal improvement**  
   Strong AI PMF rarely comes from a 10–20% speedup. It feels like:
   - “I can ship features that were impossible before.”
   - “I can do what used to need another headcount.”
   - “I can go from zero skill to ‘professional-enough’ output.”

***

## 2. Common PMF Patterns from Leading AI Agent Products

### 2.1 Cursor, Claude Code, Lovable.dev (Developer AI)

**PMF pattern: AI-native development environment**

- **Nail a single core loop**  
  Cursor’s: *Edit → Ask → Apply multi-file changes → Run → Iterate*  
  - Built directly into the editor, not a separate tab.  
  - Keyboard-first; AI is the default action (Tab-to-complete, “/” commands, inline chat).

- **Go deep on context, not breadth of features**  
  - Index whole repo, tests, docs, tools.  
  - Make refactors across many files safe and reversible.  
  - Learn team & project conventions (style, folder structure, frameworks).

- **Obsess over correctness**  
  - Minimizing hallucinations is PMF-critical in dev tools.  
  - Tight integrations with linters, tests, CI, error traces.  
  - Local mode / own API keys → trust & adoption inside companies.

- **Early PMF signal**  
  - High DAU/MAU, editor “stickiness” (replace VS Code / primary IDE).  
  - Teams standardizing on Cursor / Claude Code as policy.  
  - Users paying personally before their company does.

**Best practice you can copy:**
- Never ship a generic “AI assistant”; ship a *fully instrumented workflow* around one loop (debugging, code review, migration, onboarding, etc.), including context, tool hooks, and UX.

***

### 2.2 Devin, Manus, Agentic Dev Tools

**PMF pattern: bundle of atomic capabilities, packaged as “AI teammate”**

- **Define scope ruthlessly**  
  - Devin demo: end-to-end tasks on small-ish repos, green tests, simple tickets.  
  - Behind the scenes: extremely curated environments, tools, and guardrails.

- **Stack multiple reliable primitives**  
  - Repo understanding, task decomposition, environment setup, execution, debugging, reporting.  
  - Each primitive is tested and benchmarked; “agent” is the orchestration layer.

- **Output quality beats “autonomy theater”**  
  - What users care about: “Does this close real tickets?”  
  - Most PMF comes from reliable co-ownership of tasks, not full autonomy.

**Best practice you can copy:**
- Start by making 2–3 primitives *bulletproof* (e.g., “write tests for X”, “fix failing test”, “summarize PR”) and orchestrate them; do not chase full autonomy first.

***

### 2.3 Harvey (Law), Writer.ai (Enterprise Content), Similar Vertical AI

**PMF pattern: vertical-specific “copilot” that deeply understands constraints**

- **Regulatory and domain constraints are features**  
  - Trained / tuned on contracts, statutes, case law, firm playbooks.  
  - Hard constraints: citations, jurisdiction, tone, firm style.  
  - Robust red-team / review UI; never pretend to be self-sufficient.

- **Tight integration into incumbents’ tools**  
  - DMS, contract lifecycle tools, email, knowledge bases.  
  - One-click from “open matter” to “draft X” with pre-filled context.

- **Value narrative: billable hours & risk**  
  - “10x more productive” is measured as: fewer research hours, faster first drafts, higher matter throughput, more work per associate.

**Best practice you can copy:**
- If you’re vertical, encode the *constraints* (law, brand, compliance, templates) directly into the product; don’t leave that work to the user.

***

### 2.4 Heygen, Pika, Runway, Descript, Photoroom (Media AI)

**PMF pattern: instant “studio-level” output for non-experts**

- **Template-first, not prompt-first**  
  - Start from “Explain this SaaS feature”, “Product unboxing”, “Talking head for LinkedIn”.  
  - Parameters (language, length, style, aspect ratio) are opinionated defaults.

- **Remove entire roles from the loop**  
  - Replace scriptwriter + actor + editor + colorist + motion designer for 80% of SMB content.  
  - Simple editing mental model: text-timeline or canvas, no complex NLE jargon.

- **Distribution thinking baked into product**  
  - Export presets for TikTok, Reels, YT, ads, email, etc.  
  - One-click resizes, auto-subtitles, brand kits, versioning.

**Best practice you can copy:**
- The bar for PMF is: user can produce “good-enough-for-channel-X” content without external tools, using your app alone in one sitting.

***

### 2.5 Genspark, Knowledge / Learning Agents

**PMF pattern: highly personalized content + pacing**

- Structured “sessions”, progress tracking, curriculum views.  
- Strong personalization: prior answers, knowledge gaps, goals.  
- Outcome metric: “learn X in Y days”, exam pass rate, completion rate.

**Best practice you can copy:**
- For learning & knowledge products, tie AI to *progress metrics* (skills, tests, certifications), not just “chat about topic X”.

***

## 3. Cross-cutting PMF Practices from Non-AI Giants (Canva, Figma, Notion, etc.)

### 3.1 Canva

- **Neglected segment**: non-designers who need pro-looking graphics for social / marketing.  
- **Radical simplicity + constraints**:  
  - Drag & drop, everything on a single canvas.  
  - Guardrails via templates, layouts, font/colour pairing.  
- **Growth loop**: sharing designs → others sign up to edit / reuse templates.  
- **Monetization after value**: free core, pay for brand kits, teams, stock, etc.

**Lesson for AI products:**
- Build for *the non-expert who has the job anyway* (PMs writing SQL, founders running marketing, support agents doing analysis).

***

### 3.2 Figma

- **Single source of truth for design in the browser**  
  - PMF came from multiplayer and link-sharing, not only better drawing.  
- **Community-led growth**  
  - Public files, plugins, templates; Figma as a *platform*.  
- **Stacked PMF**  
  - First: designers. Then: PMs, engineers (handoff), orgs (Design Systems).

**Lesson:**
- For AI tools, collaboration features (comments, sessions, review, permissions) often unlock the second PMF: team & enterprise.

***

### 3.3 Notion

- **Lego blocks → infinite use cases**  
  - Few primitives: pages, databases, relations, views.  
  - Community & templates make them feel like many products.  
- **Community and influencer distribution**  
  - Power users & YouTubers turning their own workflows into templates that spread.  
- **Careful with flexibility**  
  - Notion added opinionated templates because pure flexibility is overwhelming.

**Lesson:**
- If your AI is general-purpose, *constrain with patterns and templates*, and rely on community to explore the frontier, not first-time users.

***

## 4. Concrete PMF Playbook for an AI / LLM SaaS Product

### 4.1 Define a sharp problem and user segment

Answer these in one line each:

1. **User**: “Senior backend engineer at a 20-person SaaS startup” vs “indie designer”.  
2. **Context**: “Inside VS Code on a monorepo with flaky tests” vs “inside Google Slides”.  
3. **Job**: “Ship bug-free features weekly” vs “Launch marketing campaigns faster”.  
4. **Hard outcome metric**:  
   - Less time / cost (e.g., 50% fewer hours per contract)  
   - More output (2× videos per week)  
   - Higher quality / fewer errors (defects per KLOC, A/B lift, NPS)

If you cannot specify these crisply, AI will feel like a demo, not PMF.

***

### 4.2 Build around a single “hero workflow”

Borrow from the products above:

- **For dev tools**:  
  “Given failing tests, identify root cause and propose a patch, then generate a PR with tests and explanation.”

- **For content / design tools**:  
  “Given a blog post, produce a full set of assets (hero image, carousel, social snippets, video) in brand style.”

- **For vertical tools**:  
  “Given a contract/matter/ticket, summarize, spot key risks, propose a redline/draft in house style.”

Define the hero flow as 5–8 concrete steps and ensure your product:

- Pulls all relevant context automatically (no copy-paste).  
- Minimizes mode switches (few tools, little alt-tabbing).  
- Ends in an artifact that plugs back into the existing stack (PR, DOCX, PDF, Figma file, etc.).

***

### 4.3 Opinionated UX beats raw prompting

- Ship **pre-built actions**:  
  - “Summarize this PR for a junior dev”  
  - “Generate 3 alternative headlines for this email”  
  - “Explain this clause in simple English”

- Add **sensible defaults** and **guardrails**:  
  - Length, tone, jurisdiction, brand style.  
  - Clear errors on model failures; never silently hallucinate.

- Expose **shortcuts and power-usage path** early:  
  - Slash commands, keyboard shortcuts, macros.  
  - Let power users script / extend (plugins, config files, API).

***

### 4.4 PMF Metrics Tailored to AI Products

Beyond generic SaaS metrics, focus on AI-specific ones:

1. **“Time to Wow” and first-session depth**
   - How quickly does a new user produce something truly useful (not a toy)?  
   - Track: time-to-first-PR, time-to-first-full-video, time-to-first-contract-draft.

2. **Workflow completion rate**
   - Of users who start hero flow, how many finish inside your product vs. bouncing to other tools?

3. **Quality / trust indicators**
   - “Accepted without major edits” rate.  
   - “Ship-to-prod” rate of AI-generated diffs.  
   - % outputs manually flagged as wrong / misleading.

4. **Retention + willingness to pay**
   - 7-day and 30-day retention for users who hit the hero flow.  
   - Personal credit card conversions before company pays.

5. **Internal virality**
   - # collaborators invited per active user.  
   - # docs / repos / projects shared that embed your product.

### 4.5 Qualitative PMF Tests (AI-flavored Sean Ellis test)

Run structured interviews & surveys:

- **Core question**: “If this product disappeared tomorrow, how would you feel?”  
  - Very disappointed / somewhat / not.  
  - Aim for ≥40% “very disappointed” among *target* users, not all users.

**AI-specific probes:**

- “What parts of your job does this now handle that you used to do manually?”  
- “Where do you still not trust it? Why?”  
- “What’s the last task you completed with it that you couldn’t do before (or avoided doing)?”  
- “What other tools did it replace or reduce usage of?”

Cluster responses by:

- Persona (role, seniority, company size).  
- Use case (onboarding, migrations, content type, matter type).  
- Integration surface (IDE, email, Slack, browser extension, etc.).

Your *true* PMF segment is where pain + trust + daily habit + willingness to pay overlap.

## 5. Distribution & Growth Patterns

Even with PMF, distribution is make-or-break. Patterns from the companies you mentioned:

1. **Product-led growth (PLG) + bottoms-up**
   - Cursor, Figma, Notion: free or cheap for individuals, easy collaboration → teams adopt → enterprise upsell.
   - Your play: frictionless signup, import from existing tools, 5-minute ROI.

2. **Community and content**
   - Notion, Canva, Figma, Descript: templates, public files, tutorials, YouTube as a growth engine.  
   - For AI: shareable AI “recipes”, workflows, prompt packs, project templates.

3. **“Works with X” strategy**
   - For dev tools: GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Slack.  
   - For creatives: Adobe, Figma, Canva, social platforms.  
   - For verticals: Salesforce, CLMs, DMS, EMR, etc.

4. **Surface your strongest examples**
   - Show real case studies: “saved 6 hours per contract”, “2x content velocity”, “50% fewer bugs reaching prod.”  
   - AI is still magic to many; concrete examples build trust.

## 6. Common Failure Modes in AI PMF (and How These Products Avoided Them)

1. **Being a thin wrapper around a foundation model**
   - No proprietary data, no workflow integration, no UX innovation.  
   - Counter: Cursor, Harvey, Writer.ai own *data*, *integrations*, and *domain-specific scaffolding*.

2. **Chasing breadth over depth**
   - Trying to support every persona and task from day one.  
   - Counter: Each success story started in a narrow wedge:  
     - Canva → non-designers on social/marketing.  
     - Figma → product designers.  
     - Notion → early adopters building personal/productivity systems.

3. **Over-indexing on “cool demos”**
   - Autonomy demos that don’t survive real constraints (legacy systems, flaky infra, messy data).  
   - Counter: early partnerships (e.g., law firms, design teams, startups) where the team iterates deeply with a small cohort.

## 7. A Practical 90-Day PMF Plan for an AI Agent / SaaS Product

**Days 0–15: Narrow & instrument**

- Pick 1 persona, 1 context, 1 hero job.  
- Map the exact workflow and tools (screenshots, click paths).  
- Implement a minimal version: one surface + one or two strong primitives.  
- Add analytics: step funnels, success/failure tags, session replays.

**Days 16–45: Deep co-building with 10–20 “design partners”**

- Sit next to users (or screen share) as they work.  
- Collect every failure, confusion, and workaround.  
- Ship improvements weekly: context handling, templates, UI tweaks.  
- Ask them to “try doing the whole task only in our product” once a week.

**Days 46–75: Systematize trust & reliability**

- Add explicit confirmations, diffs, change previews, rollbacks.  
- Add domain constraints (style guides, templates, policies).  
- Build a small evaluation suite (benchmarks on real tasks).  
- Start tracking “accepted without major edits” and “zero-edit tasks”.

**Days 76–90: Test early PMF & growth loops**

- Run a mini Sean Ellis survey with your active users.  
- Identify your most successful persona + use case combo.  
- Create 3–5 public templates / recipes from those workflows.  
- Turn your best user stories into landing pages and demo videos.

## 8. How to Use This for Your Own Product

If you share:

- What you are building (domain, users, current feature set), and  
- Where you are in the lifecycle (idea, beta, some paying users),

a tailored PMF roadmap can be sketched that borrows specific patterns from the most relevant analogs (e.g., Cursor-like if you’re dev-focused, Harvey-like if you’re vertical B2B, Canva-like if you’re prosumer/creator).
