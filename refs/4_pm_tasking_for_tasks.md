# step 4: tasking methodology

Step 4 corresponds to the **tasks.md / `/speckit.tasks`** phase in Spec Kit, but focused on **PMF for an AI/LLM SaaS product**, not on code implementation.

Where `plan.md` (Step 3) defines *strategy and plan* (objectives, wedge, channels, growth loops, experiments), this step turns that plan into an **executable task list**:

- Clear phases and milestones.  
- Concrete tasks and subtasks.  
- Owners and collaborators.  
- Checkpoints, reviews, and tests (PDCA cycles).  
- Enough structure that a small team can run it like a project.

This is the PMF/growth equivalent of a `tasks.md` file for a feature.

---

## 1. Principles for PMF tasking (AI SaaS)

- **Phase and milestone-oriented:** chunk work into phases (e.g., Discovery, Beta, Launch, Scale) with clear exit criteria.
- **Workflow-first:** tasks should drive users through hero workflows, not random feature work.
- **Experiment-driven:** every block of tasks should connect to a hypothesis and a metric.
- **Ownership and accountability:** each task has an owner and, where needed, a domain collaborator.
- **PDCA loops:** Plan → Do → Check → Act at the level of sprints and major experiments.
- **Documentation-light but decision-heavy:** capture decisions, not just actions.

---

## 2. Suggested phases for a PMF tasks.md

You can adapt this structure for your own AI SaaS product:

1. **Phase 0 – Foundations & Alignment**  
2. **Phase 1 – Persona & Problem Validation**  
3. **Phase 2 – Hero Workflow Validation**  
4. **Phase 3 – Launch & Activation**  
5. **Phase 4 – Growth Loops & Channels**  
6. **Phase 5 – PMF Deepening & Scale Readiness**

Each phase should include:

- Goals and exit criteria.  
- Tasks grouped by theme (research, product, growth, ops).  
- Owners.  
- Checkpoints and review rituals.

---

## 3. Tasks structure template

For each phase:

### 3.1 Phase header

- **Phase name:** (e.g., “Phase 1 – Persona & Problem Validation”).  
- **Timebox:** e.g., 2–4 weeks.  
- **Goal:** one or two measurable outcomes tied to PMF (e.g., “Validate that Persona A has problem X and is willing to try Y workflow.”).  
- **Exit criteria:** concrete conditions to move to next phase.

### 3.2 Task breakdown

Use a table or checklist style similar to code `tasks.md`, but focused on PMF work. For example:

- **[P]** = can be done in parallel.  
- **[Owner]** = primary responsible person.  
- **[Check]** = checkpoint or review.

Example pattern:

- **[Task ID]** Short task name  
  - Description: what exactly needs to happen.  
  - Owner: [name/role].  
  - Type: research / product / growth / ops.  
  - Dependencies: tasks that must be done first.  
  - Deliverable: doc, decision, metric, artifact.  
  - Due: [date or sprint].

### 3.3 Checkpoints and reviews

For each phase, define explicit checkpoints:

- **Mid-phase review:** are tasks on track; early signals.  
- **End-of-phase review:** did we meet exit criteria; what did we learn; what changes.

Use PDCA:

- **Plan:** hypotheses and tasks for the next cycle.  
- **Do:** execute tasks.  
- **Check:** review metrics and qualitative feedback.  
- **Act:** adjust personas, workflows, channels, or plan based on findings.

---

## 4. Example PMF task phases (high-level)

### 4.1 Phase 0 – Foundations & Alignment

**Goal:** Ensure team alignment on PMF target, personas, and workflows; set up basic tooling for experiments and measurement.

Example tasks:

- [T0.1] Align on primary persona, segment, JTBD, and hero workflow  
  - Owner: Product.  
  - Deliverable: 1–2 page alignment doc.

- [T0.2] Define PMF metrics and initial dashboard requirements  
  - Owner: Product/Growth.  
  - Deliverable: metrics spec.

- [T0.3] Set up basic analytics and data capture (events, funnels)  
  - Owner: Growth/Analytics.  
  - Deliverable: events schema and initial dashboards (even if basic).

- [T0.4] Create user research pipeline (recruiting script, intake form, calendar slots)  
  - Owner: Product/UX.  
  - Deliverable: repeatable process to get users into calls.

**Exit criteria:**  
- Personas & hero workflows documented and agreed.  
- Core PMF metrics defined.  
- Lightweight analytics capture ready.

### 4.2 Phase 1 – Persona & Problem Validation

**Goal:** Validate that chosen personas actually have the problems and JTBD you think they do, at the right intensity and frequency.

Example tasks:

- [T1.1] Conduct N (e.g., 10–20) interviews with target persona about their current workflows and pains.  
  - Owner: Product.  
  - Deliverable: interview notes and synthesis.

- [T1.2] Map problems → JTBD → existing tools/workarounds.  
  - Owner: Product/UX.  
  - Deliverable: JTBD map.

- [T1.3] Prioritize top 3 JTBD for PMF wedge.  
  - Owner: Product + Founder.  
  - Deliverable: ranked JTBD list with rationale.

**Exit criteria:**  
- Clear, evidence-backed decision on primary persona and top JTBD.  
- Confidence that these JTBD occur frequently and have budget.

### 4.3 Phase 2 – Hero Workflow Validation

**Goal:** Validate that your hero workflow is understandable, usable, and capable of producing “good enough” results.

Example tasks:

- [T2.1] Define step-by-step hero workflow in user terms (not technical).  
  - Owner: Product.  
  - Deliverable: user journey / storyboard.

- [T2.2] Run N live sessions where users attempt the hero workflow on their own data.  
  - Owner: Product/UX.  
  - Deliverable: notes on friction points, time to completion, satisfaction.

- [T2.3] Identify and prioritize top 5 friction points (UX, comprehension, value).  
  - Owner: Product/Growth.  
  - Deliverable: prioritized improvements list.

- [T2.4] Implement non-technical improvements (e.g., better defaults, templates, instructions) and re-test.  
  - Owner: Product.  
  - Deliverable: updated workflow.

**Exit criteria:**  
- Majority of test users can complete the hero workflow with acceptable satisfaction.  
- “Wow moments” observed and captured as stories.

### 4.4 Phase 3 – Launch & Activation

**Goal:** Run focused launches in chosen channels to drive activated users through hero workflows.

Example tasks:

- [T3.1] Prepare launch assets per channel (X, Reddit, PH, LinkedIn, etc.)  
  - Owner: Growth.  
  - Deliverable: posts, landing pages, demo videos.

- [T3.2] Define activation success criteria (hero workflow completion) and instrumentation.  
  - Owner: Product/Growth.  
  - Deliverable: activation spec.

- [T3.3] Run initial launch on 1–2 primary channels (timeboxed).  
  - Owner: Founder/Growth.  
  - Deliverable: campaign executed.

- [T3.4] Perform activation review after N days (e.g., 7–14).  
  - Owner: Product/Growth.  
  - Deliverable: report on conversion to activation, early retention.

**Exit criteria:**  
- Evidence of a repeatable path: from channel → signup → hero workflow completion.  
- Clear view of strongest early channels.

### 4.5 Phase 4 – Growth Loops & Channels

**Goal:** Design and execute tasks that build and optimize growth loops (content, templates, collaboration) and deepen high-performing channels.

Example tasks:

- [T4.1] Define 1–2 core growth loops and map them as tasks.  
  - Owner: Growth.  
  - Deliverable: loop diagrams and hypotheses.

- [T4.2] Seed template library or example gallery aligned with hero workflows.  
  - Owner: Product/Content.  
  - Deliverable: initial template set.

- [T4.3] Run X “build in public” posts per week on X/LinkedIn summarizing progress and user stories.  
  - Owner: Founder.  
  - Deliverable: consistent social presence.

- [T4.4] Launch or grow community space (Discord/Slack) with weekly office hours.  
  - Owner: Growth/Product.  
  - Deliverable: engaged early community.

**Exit criteria:**  
- At least one growth loop shows evidence of compounding (e.g., more users per week joining via templates, shares, or collaboration).  
- Clear understanding of which channels + narratives drive the best activated users.

### 4.6 Phase 5 – PMF Deepening & Scale Readiness

**Goal:** Consolidate learning, strengthen core workflows, and prepare for either deeper PMF or early scale.

Example tasks:

- [T5.1] Run structured PMF survey (e.g., Sean Ellis) on activated users.  
  - Owner: Product.  
  - Deliverable: PMF score and qualitative data.

- [T5.2] Analyze usage by segment and workflow to find strongest clusters.  
  - Owner: Growth/Analytics.  
  - Deliverable: usage segmentation.

- [T5.3] Define next set of workflow or segment bets (double down or pivot).  
  - Owner: Product/Founder.  
  - Deliverable: roadmap doc.

- [T5.4] Identify scale risks (support load, reliability, onboarding) and tasks to mitigate.  
  - Owner: Ops/Product.  
  - Deliverable: risk mitigation task list.

**Exit criteria:**  
- Clear sense of where PMF is strongest (persona + workflow + channel).  
- Prioritized roadmap to deepen or extend PMF.

## 5. Perplexity research prompt

Use the prompt below in Perplexity (or similar tools) to gather **best-practice tasking and execution patterns** for taking an AI/LLM SaaS product from PMF plan to day-to-day tasks and sprints.

```prompt
you are an expert product and growth operator with deep experience in ai/llm saas and agent products (2023–2025), and a background in pragmatic project management.

context:

- step 0–3 in my pmf-kit have already produced: an overview of pmf for ai saas, principles and patterns, a pmf-focused spec (personas, problems, hero workflows, constraints, success metrics), and a non-technical pmf plan.md (objectives, strategy, launch/activation, growth loops, metrics, risks).
- now i want to create a **tasks.md** focused on execution and tasking for pmf and growth, not on engineering implementation (no stacks/architecture).

please extensively research **recent (2023–2025)** playbooks and examples on how successful ai/llm saas products and high-performing silicon valley teams:

- break their pmf and growth plans into **phases, tasks, and sprints**
- use **product-led growth, growth hacking, and virality** in a structured, project-managed way
- define **owners, milestones, checkpoints, and PDCA loops** for pmf experiments
- manage tasks across product, design, growth, content, and community for an early-stage ai saas or agent product

focus on concrete practices and case studies from tools such as cursor, claude code, devin, manus, lovable.dev, runway, pika, heygen, photoroom, harvey, writer.ai, canva, figma, notion, and similar products.

for each relevant source or pattern you find, extract:

1. how they structure pmf and growth **phases** (discovery, beta, launch, scale)
2. how they translate plans into **task lists** with clear owners and deadlines
3. how they embed **checkpoints, reviews, and pmf decisions** into their cadence
4. how they coordinate **cross-functional tasks** (product, growth, community, content) during early pmf
5. any publicly shared **templates or checklists** for tasking around pmf

then synthesize your findings into a tasking playbook tailored to my context, including:

- a proposed structure for a pmf-focused **tasks.md** (phases, task groups, ownership, checkpoints, exit criteria)
- examples of concrete tasks for ai saas pmf work (user research, launch campaigns, growth loop experiments, community building, metrics reviews)
- guidance on using **PDCA (plan–do–check–act)** and sprint cadences to iterate on pmf experiments
- suggestions on how to incorporate social channels (twitter/x, reddit, product hunt, linkedin, youtube, tiktok, discord) into the task list in a disciplined way

present the answer as a markdown document that i can adapt directly into `step 4: tasking methodology` and a `tasks.md` file in my pmf-kit.


```


# tasks.md – Tasking Methodology for PMF & Growth (AI/LLM SaaS 2023–2025)

This document is a pragmatic, execution-focused playbook for driving PMF and growth. It is non-technical (no stacks/architecture) and designed for early-stage AI/LLM SaaS or agent products.

Use it as `step 4: tasking methodology` and as the basis for your `tasks.md`.

***

## 1. Overall structure of tasks.md

Recommended top-level structure:

1. Phases & Exit Criteria  
2. Task Groups & Ownership  
3. PDCA & Sprint Cadence  
4. Channel & Growth Tasking  
5. Example Task Backlog (by function)  

***

## 2. Phases & Exit Criteria

High-performing AI SaaS teams implicitly follow 3–4 PMF phases (even if not labeled this way). Make them explicit in your tasks.md.

### Phase 1 – Discovery / Problem–Solution Fit

Goal: Validate persona, JTBD, and hero workflows are real, painful, and valuable.

Exit criteria (examples):

- Spoke to at least 20–30 target users in your niche.  
- Clear, repeated JTBD patterns.  
- 1–2 hero workflows defined and manually validated (even with partial or “Wizard of Oz” execution).  
- At least 5–10 users have manually run the workflow with you and said they’d be disappointed if it disappeared.

Typical duration: 4–8 weeks.

Core task groups:

- User research  
- Problem/JTBD validation  
- Hero workflow design  
- Early design partner recruiting

### Phase 2 – Beta / PMF Exploration

Goal: Make the hero workflow self-serve for a small but real cohort; test product-led activation and retention.

Exit criteria:

- 20–100 users have completed the hero workflow self-serve with their own data.  
- Clear activation definition and basic instrumentation in place.  
- Early retention signal in a narrow segment (e.g., 30–50% of activated users still active at 4 weeks for a weekly-use product).  
- 5–10 users strongly advocating for the product.

Typical duration: 8–12 weeks (multiple sprints).

Core task groups:

- Onboarding & activation  
- UX refinement of hero workflows  
- Basic PLG motions (templates, shareable artifacts)  
- Community setup (Discord, early champions)

### Phase 3 – Launch / Early Scale

Goal: Scale acquisition for the same wedge while strengthening activation, retention, and monetization.

Exit criteria:

- Stable activation and retention metrics for the core segment.  
- Repeatable, semi-predictable acquisition channels (e.g., X + TikTok, or LinkedIn + conferences).  
- First paying teams/accounts, not just individuals.  
- Clear path to expand workflows or segments without destabilizing PMF.

Typical duration: ongoing; re-framed every ~6 months.

Core task groups:

- Growth experiments & loops  
- Monetization tests (pricing, packaging)  
- Collaboration and team features  
- Expansion workflow design (adjacent use cases)

***

## 3. Task Groups & Ownership

Structure tasks around outcomes, not functions, but assign clear owners.

Core cross-functional groups you’ll reference:

- Product (PM)  
- UX/Design  
- Growth/Marketing  
- Community/Content  
- Data/Analytics (lightweight early on – often same as product/growth)  
- Domain Expert (for verticals: legal, marketing, dev tooling, etc.)

In tasks.md, define:

- For each phase:
  - Objectives.  
  - Task groups.  
  - Owner for each group (name, not role).  
  - Checkpoints (weekly/biweekly).

Example structure snippet:

- Phase: Beta / PMF Exploration  
  - Objective: Validate self-serve hero workflow for [persona] and achieve 30% 4-week retention of activated users.  
  - Task groups:
    - User Research (Owner: PM)  
    - Onboarding & UX (Owner: Design)  
    - Growth Experiments (Owner: Growth)  
    - Community & Support (Owner: Community)  
    - Metrics & Reporting (Owner: Analytics/Product)

***

## 4. PDCA & Sprint Cadence

High-performing teams implicitly run PDCA (Plan–Do–Check–Act) loops and combine product and growth sprints.

### 4.1 PDCA applied to PMF

For each sprint (4–6 weeks):

- Plan:
  - Set 1–2 PMF hypotheses per phase:
    - “If we reduce steps in onboarding from 6 to 3 and add a guided demo, activation will increase from 15% → 30%.”  
    - “If we seed templates and run 3 TikToks showing them, exports per new user will increase by 25%.”
  - Choose which hero workflow and which channel to prioritize.

- Do:
  - Implement the minimum set of tasks to test those hypotheses:
    - UX changes, copy changes, new template, small channel experiment.

- Check:
  - At end of sprint, review:
    - Activation/retention/engagement changes.  
    - Qualitative feedback (user interviews, community posts).

- Act:
  - Decide to:
    - Double down on what worked.  
    - Refine and re-run with changes.  
    - Kill experiments that didn’t move the needle.

Document PDCA in tasks.md:

- Each sprint gets:
  - Hypotheses list.  
  - Planned tasks.  
  - Check metrics (with dates).  
  - Act decisions.

### 4.2 Sprint cadence

Recommend:

- Sprint length: 2 weeks for internal execution; group 2–3 sprints into a 4–6 week PMF cycle focused on one wedge.  
- Weekly ritual:
  - 60–90 min PMF review:
    - Previous week’s metrics.  
    - Qualitative insights.  
    - Status on key tasks.  
    - Re-prioritization.

In tasks.md, define:

- “Sprint 1 (Weeks X–Y) – Focus: [Hero workflow A activation]”  
- “Sprint 2 (Weeks Y–Z) – Focus: [Hero workflow A retention + loop 1]”

***

## 6. Example tasks for AI SaaS PMF (by phase & function)

Below are concrete, plug-and-play examples.

### 6.1 Phase 1 – Discovery (Problem–Solution Fit)

User research & domain:

- Identify 30 target users matching persona A; create outreach list.  
- Conduct 10–15 problem interviews (45–60 minutes) to map workflows and JTBD.  
- Synthesize insights into 3–5 concrete JTBD and rank them.  
- Run “day in the life” mapping for 3 representative users.

Product & UX (non-technical):

- Draft 1–2 hero workflow narratives (storyboards, not UI pixels).  
- Create low-fidelity prototypes (even in slides) for walkthroughs.  
- Facilitate 5 prototype sessions to test desirability and clarity.

Growth & channels:

- Reserve and set up brand handles on X, LinkedIn, and relevant communities.  
- Post 2–3 “problem-focused” threads on X to attract and talk to your persona.  
- Engage with existing community posts about similar problems (without pitching yet).

Community & content:

- Write a “why now” and “for whom” one-pager.  
- Create a simple landing page with email capture and problem framing.

Metrics & analysis:

- Define basic research CRM:
  - Track who you spoke with, persona fit, problem pain score, and JTBD summary.  
- Define first draft of activation and retention metrics (even if not measured yet).

### 6.2 Phase 2 – Beta / PMF Exploration

User research:

- Recruit 10–20 design partners willing to use early product on real work.  
- Schedule weekly office hours for them.  
- Run 5–10 “watch them work” sessions where they use your hero workflow with their own assets.

Product & UX:

- Build and refine onboarding around hero workflow (copy, steps, demo content).  
- Create 1 “happy path” demo script: step-by-step that a new user can follow.  
- Add in-product prompts or tooltips to guide users through the workflow.  
- Implement minimal “escape hatches” (easy way to revert or exit if something goes wrong).

Growth & channels:

- X/Twitter:
  - 3 posts per week:
    - 1: hero workflow demo.  
    - 1: behind-the-scenes or learning from user sessions.  
    - 1: user story or small case study (with permission).  
- Reddit:
  - 1 deep-dive post per month in a relevant subreddit about your problem space; include learnings and ask for feedback.  
- Product Hunt (if ready):
  - Prepare launch assets (description, video, screenshots).  
  - Create a follow-up flow for PH signups (emails + in-app guidance).

Community & content:

- Launch a small Discord or Slack for early users.  
- Weekly:
  - Share changelog.  
  - Ask for one specific type of feedback (e.g., “How was your first export?”).  
- Spotlight early users and showcase what they created.

Metrics & analysis:

- Stand up basic tracking of:
  - Signups → hero workflow completion → repeat usage.  
  - Time-to-first-completion.  
- Weekly:
  - Export a list of new signups who did and did not activate.  
  - Reach out to 5 non-activated users for 15-minute calls about blockers.

### 6.3 Phase 3 – Launch / Early Scale

User research:

- Segment users into:
  - Power users (top 10–20 by workflow usage).  
  - Casual but retained.  
  - Churned.  
- Run separate interview scripts for each segment to understand why.

Product & UX:

- Formalize hero workflow into presets/templates for different segments.  
- Add collaboration flows (share links, comments, approvals) if relevant.  
- Experiment with 1–2 monetization levers (e.g., limits, Pro features).

Growth & channels:

- X/Twitter:
  - Continue show-don’t-tell demos, now with more case-study framing.  
- LinkedIn:
  - Share vertical-specific case studies (especially for Harvey/Writer-style tools).  
- YouTube/TikTok:
  - Create 3–5 tutorials showing end-to-end workflows.  
  - Encourage creators to make their own videos; support them with guidance.

Community & content:

- Run monthly “office hours” or live demos on Discord/Zoom.  
- Build a small library of workflow guides and templates on your site.  
- Launch a “template gallery” or “use case gallery” in-product.

Metrics & analysis:

- Track workflow-level metrics segmented by acquisition channel.  
- Reporting cadence:
  - Weekly: activation, usage, support issues.  
  - Monthly: retention, conversion, feature adoption.

***

## 7. Embedding PDCA & Checkpoints in tasks.md

Add these recurring tasks:

Weekly (Check/Act):

- Review:
  - Activation rate for hero workflows.  
  - Number of successful runs per active user.  
  - Key qualitative support/community feedback.  
- Decide:
  - Which tasks roll over.  
  - Which hypotheses are invalidated/confirmed.  
  - Which new experiments to add.

Sprint-end (every 2 weeks):

- Sprint review:
  - Did we move the target metric?  
  - Which tasks had the most/least impact?  
  - What did we learn about persona, JTBD, workflows, or channels?

Phase-end:

- Compare metrics and qualitative signals to phase exit criteria.  
- Decide whether to:
  - Stay in phase (need more proof).  
  - Move to next phase (e.g., from Beta to Launch).  
  - Narrow or adjust wedge.

In tasks.md, create small templates:

- Weekly PMF review agenda.  
- Sprint retrospective template.  
- Phase exit checklist.

***

## 8. Channel-specific tasking (disciplined use)

Instead of “post everywhere,” treat each channel as its own mini-project with tasks and success criteria.

Example per-channel blocks:

X/Twitter:

- Weekly tasks:
  - Draft and schedule 3 posts demonstrating hero workflows.  
  - Engage with 10 posts from your core persona’s network.  
  - DM 3–5 high-fit users for feedback or early access (respectfully).  
- Checkpoint:
  - Track signups and activations tagged to X.  
  - Review which posts drove the most qualified traffic.

Reddit:

- Monthly tasks:
  - Write 1 high-quality, non-promotional post about problems and learnings.  
  - Answer comments, collect feedback into internal notes.  
- Checkpoint:
  - Did Reddit traffic produce any activated users? If not, reconsider effort.

Product Hunt:

- Launch tasks:
  - Prepare copy, visuals, and a “welcome PH users” landing/onboarding.  
  - Coordinate with friends/community to engage on launch day.  
- Post-launch tasks:
  - Reach out to the top 20 signups who best fit persona A for interviews and onboarding.  
- Checkpoint:
  - Evaluate: PH as activation source vs vanity.

LinkedIn:

- Weekly tasks (if vertical/enterprise-focused):
  - Share 1 domain insight post and 1 product/usage post.  
  - Request 1–2 customer quotes or micro case studies to share.  
- Checkpoint:
  - Track high-intent conversations and pilots sourced from LinkedIn.

YouTube/TikTok:

- Bi-weekly tasks:
  - Record 1–2 short tutorials or breakdowns of workflows.  
  - Add CTAs to try the product with a specific template or use case.  
- Checkpoint:
  - Track clicks/signups and whether they activate.

Discord/Community:

- Weekly tasks:
  - Post changelog and ask for feedback on 1 specific area.  
  - Highlight 1–2 user creations.  
  - Run 1 small poll on roadmap priorities.  
- Checkpoint:
  - Assess whether community feedback results in concrete product improvements.

***

## 9. Putting it together

To adapt this directly:

1. Copy the structure in sections 2–5 into your tasks.md.  
2. Fill in:
   - Current phase and exit criteria (from your plan.md).  
   - Current sprint focus and hypotheses.  
   - Concrete tasks under each task group, with owners and due dates.  
3. Add recurring PDCA and channel tasks, tuned to your team size and bandwidth.  
4. Use tasks.md as a living document:
   - Updated weekly after PMF review.  
   - Rewritten after each major phase transition.

This gives you a pragmatic, disciplined way to turn your PMF spec and plan into day-to-day execution, aligned with how modern AI/LLM SaaS and agent teams operate in 2023–2025.
