# step 6.1: use claude code to build constitution.md

```prompt

/constitution this pmf-kit project is a folk from the github.com spec-kit project. read @README_spec-kit.md to have a global view of the original spec-kit project. spec-driven
  development is a great methodology for doing complex work with llm-based agents. the same methodology may be applied in different areas like project management, product design,
  marketing, business writing, and thousands of other jobs. the pmf-kit is a featured variant version from spec-kit , is for the project management of finding product-market-fit of
  ai saas products. i will also use this project as an great example of how to make your own spec-kit varients, like pm-kit, pd-kit, marketing-kit, biz-writing-kit. i will develope
  comprehensive documents in @refs/ to show how to step by step use prompts and search tools to prepare for up to date references and edit the templates of the original spec-kit
  repo.   in the constitution of this task, there are a few things are important. 1. i want to take advantage of the whole spec-kit repo design including the way it install and the
  command cli, the way it works with claude code cursor and other coding agents. 2. since users may install many spec-kit like kits, the command "specify" may have conflict with
  different packages, you need find a way to avoid conflict if user install spec-kit, pmf-kit, pd-kit and more kits on the same computer. 3. related to 2, "speckit.plan"
  "speckit.implent" ... are the ways to call the command inside claude code or other compatiable coding agents products. you must also make sure there is no conflict of using
  "speckit.plan" and "pmfkit.plan". they can trigger different agents. think carefully and globally first , and then generate the constitution for pmf-kit
