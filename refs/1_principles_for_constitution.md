# Step 1: Principles of PMF

Based on step 0, you now have enough keywords, examples, and case references from [0_overview.md] to go deeper. Use this file to design a new perplexity.ai search prompt (or similar agentic search) that focuses specifically on **principles and patterns** behind successful pmf for ai/llm saas and agent products.

The goal of this step is not to collect more raw examples, but to distill **clear, reusable principles** you can treat as a “pmf constitution” for this kit and future variants.

```prompt
You are an expert product strategist and AI SaaS operator working in 2024–2025.

Using the latest public sources, deeply research **principles of successful product-market fit (PMF) for AI / LLM SaaS and agent products**.

Focus especially on concrete patterns from:

- Developer / agent tools: Cursor, Claude Code, Devin, Manus, Lovable.dev
- Creative / media tools: Runway, Pika, HeyGen, Descript, PhotoRoom
- Vertical / enterprise tools: Harvey (legal), Writer.ai, other vertical copilots

Research questions:

1. **Definition & shape of PMF for AI SaaS in 2024–2025**  
   - How is PMF for AI / agent products different from classic SaaS PMF?  
   - What are the most important characteristics of “real” PMF vs hype (e.g., repeat usage, workflow integration, willingness to pay, word of mouth)?

2. **Core product principles behind PMF**  
   - Narrow, high-value job-to-be-done (JTBD) and sharp target persona.  
   - AI-native workflows vs “AI added on top”.  
   - Opinionated flows and templates vs open-ended chat.  
   - Reliability, trust, safety, and control as first-class product features.

3. **Planning & execution patterns**  
   - How winning teams choose the initial wedge use case.  
   - How they design a single "hero workflow" end-to-end (from user intent to finished artifact or outcome).  
   - How they iterate with design partners / early adopters (feedback cadence, experiments, instrumentation).  
   - How they deepen one workflow before expanding horizontally.

4. **Measurement and metrics**  
   - Behavioral and financial PMF signals (retention curves, usage depth, revenue, expansion).  
   - AI-specific metrics: task completion rate, edit distance, prompt-to-output time, autonomy rate, trust/quality indicators.  
   - Example metrics or benchmarks mentioned publicly for the companies above, where available.

5. **Distribution and growth loops**  
   - How these products acquire, activate, and retain users (PLG, community, templates, shareable artifacts, integrations).  
   - How they expand from individual users to teams and enterprises.

6. **Common failure modes**  
   - Typical ways AI PMF efforts fail (e.g., thin wrappers on foundation models, feature sprawl, autonomy theater, lack of focus).  
   - How the successful products above avoided or solved these issues.

# Principles of Product-Market Fit (PMF) for AI SaaS Products

## What PMF Means for AI SaaS Now (2024–2025)

For classic SaaS, PMF usually means: a defined segment uses the product frequently, churn is low, revenue is growing, and word of mouth drives an increasing share of acquisition.

For AI / LLM and agentic SaaS in 2024–2025, PMF has a distinct “shape”:

- **Workflow-level adoption, not feature-level curiosity**  
  Users don’t just “try the AI feature”; they run meaningful, repeatable workflows through it:
  - Developers live in Cursor or Claude Code for hours a day, not just asking one-off questions.
  - Creators run entire video projects through Runway or Pika, from rough idea to export.
  - Lawyers rely on Harvey to draft and review real client work.
  - Marketers and SMBs use PhotoRoom or Canva for every new product photo or social asset.

- **From “cool demo” to “default tool”**  
  PMF appears when your AI product becomes the *default* way a persona does a specific job:
  - “I don’t open my old IDE anymore” (Cursor/Claude Code/Devin-type tools).
  - “I don’t hire a video editor for X type of content now” (Runway, Pika, HeyGen).
  - “We don’t start from a blank Figma/Notion doc; we ask the AI and edit.”

- **Willingness to pay for outcomes, not technology**  
  Buyers don’t care which model you use; they care that:
  - Work is faster and more consistent.
  - Quality is high enough for production.
  - The product fits security, compliance, and integration requirements (especially enterprise tools like Harvey and Writer).

- **Compounding word-of-mouth and community pull**  
  - Dev tools (Cursor, Lovable.dev, Claude Code) spread through GitHub, X, Discord, engineering Slack.
  - Creative tools (Runway, Pika, HeyGen, PhotoRoom, Canva) spread through visible outputs on TikTok, YouTube, and marketplaces.
  - Knowledge tools (Notion, Writer) spread when docs and templates are shared across teams.

**Key differences vs classic SaaS PMF:**

- **Higher early hype, higher “fake PMF” risk**  
  AI demos draw signups and social media attention; many of those users never return. True PMF is in *retained workflows*, not waitlist size or launch-day traffic.

- **Model quality and data loops matter more**  
  The *engine* (models, prompts, retrieval, fine-tuning) and the *data exhaust* (logs, corrections, feedback) are ongoing PMF levers, not one-time build costs.

- **Trust, safety, and reliability are core PMF dimensions**  
  For legal (Harvey), enterprise writing (Writer), or coding (Cursor, Devin-like agents), subtle trust issues (hallucinations, data leakage, unstable behavior) directly cap PMF.

***

## Core Product Principles Behind PMF

### 1. Narrow, High-Value JTBD and Sharp Persona

The winning AI SaaS products pick a **very specific job** for a **very specific user**:

- **Developer/agent tools**
  - Cursor: “Make shipping code in your editor radically faster and less painful for professional developers.”
  - Claude Code / Devin-style agents: “Handle well-scoped coding tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously, integrated with repos and tools.”
  - Lovable.dev: “Ship MVPs quickly for indie devs and small teams.”

- **Creative / media tools**
  - Runway: “Turn ideas into high-quality video and motion content for creators and studios.”
  - Pika: “Generate short, stylized, social-ready video clips from text or simple inputs.”
  - HeyGen: “Produce talking-head and avatar videos for marketing, localization, and training.”
  - PhotoRoom: “Make product photos and social visuals for commerce without a designer or studio.”

- **Vertical / enterprise**
  - Harvey: “Draft, review, and analyze legal documents and matters for law firms and in-house teams.”
  - Writer: “Generate, standardize, and govern enterprise content across marketing, support, and operations.”

- **Iconic PLG SaaS**
  - Canva: “Empower non-designers to make good-looking designs quickly.”
  - Figma: “Collaborative interface design for product teams and designers.”
  - Notion: “Flexible workspace for docs, notes, and lightweight databases.”

**Actionable guidance:**

- Write a one-sentence “who + job + context” statement that would be obvious to your users.  
- If your target is “everyone” or your job is “anything with AI,” you’re too broad.  
- Force-rank 1–2 JTBDs and kill the rest until you see traction in at least one.

***

### 2. AI-Native Workflows vs “AI Added On”

Products with strong PMF are **built around AI from the ground up**:

- Cursor is not “VS Code + AI plugin”; it rethinks the editor around chat, inline edits, context windows, and repo-level understanding.
- Runway is not “Premiere with an AI tab”; it orients the entire app around generative video and interactive previews.
- Harvey and Writer aren’t “LLM wrappers”; they integrate firm/company knowledge, style guides, policies, approval flows, and governance.

**Characteristics of AI-native workflows:**

- The primary interaction is **intent → AI draft → user edits**, not manual creation + optional AI.
- The UI is optimized for **fast iteration with AI**: quick re-prompts, variations, and side-by-side comparisons.
- The product architecture assumes **continuous model improvement and experimentation**, not static rules.

**Actionable guidance:**

- Start by designing the **ideal AI-powered workflow** (ignoring what your legacy tool does), then build that.  
- Avoid shipping “AI sidebars” that feel bolted on unless you’re in a deliberate transition phase.

***

### 3. Opinionated Flows and Templates vs Open-Ended Chat

Open-ended chat is powerful but usually has weak PMF because users must invent good prompts and workflows.

The successful tools are **opinionated**:

- Runway: mode-specific tools and templates (text-to-video, image-to-video, inpainting, style transfers).
- Pika: clear modes and styles; the UI nudges you into “make a short video like this” instead of blank text fields.
- Canva / Figma / Notion: thousands of templates, components, and patterns that encode *how* to work.
- Harvey: workflows keyed to specific legal tasks (draft an NDA, summarize a contract, compare clauses).
- PhotoRoom: single-click flows like “remove background,” “replace background,” “mockup for e-commerce.”

**Actionable guidance:**

- Identify your top 3–5 **standard workflows** and ship them as explicit modes or templates.  
- Provide **structured inputs** (forms, dropdowns, toggles) that shape good prompts and reduce cognitive load.  
- Offer chat where needed, but make it a *supporting* interface, not the only one.

***

### 4. Reliability, Trust, Safety, and Control as First-Class Features

For dev, legal, enterprise, and creative professionals, **trust** is a non-negotiable PMF pillar:

- Developer tools:
  - Guardrails on destructive actions (e.g., explicit confirmation before large refactors).
  - Visibility into changes (diffs, tests, logs) so AI is auditable.
  - Ability to scope tasks to a file, folder, or repo.

- Legal / enterprise:
  - Clear separation between **internal** and **external** data.
  - Custom models grounded in firm/company knowledge.
  - Approval steps, redlines, version history, and audit trails.
  - Compliance and security certifications.

- Creative tools:
  - Style consistency, brand presets, rights and licensing clarity.
  - Controls for camera movement, style strength, timing.

**Actionable guidance:**

- Treat **“confidence and control” UX** as a core product area:
  - Explicit warnings for low-confidence answers or hallucination-prone tasks.
  - Easy rollback and versioning.
  - Clear, minimal controls that map to meaningful behavior (e.g., “creativity vs precision”).
- Design a “human in the loop” pattern for all high-stakes use cases.

***

### 5. Speed, UX, and Time-to-First-Wow

Latency and friction kill PMF for AI products.

High-PMF tools share:

- **Fast feedback loops**:
  - Cursor/Claude Code-style inline suggestions and streaming outputs.
  - Runway/Pika previews and low-res drafts before full renders.
  - PhotoRoom/Canva one-click transforms with instant visual feedback.

- **Time-to-first-wow (TTFW)**:
  - New users get a compelling outcome in minutes, often on their own data or assets.
  - Onboarding is action-oriented: upload, paste, or connect something and see magic.

- **Progressive disclosure**:
  - Novices see a simple path: upload → click template → done.
  - Power users can dig into advanced settings, fine-tuning, and integrations.

**Actionable guidance:**

- Instrument TTFW: measure time from signup to first successful, high-value outcome.  
- Ruthlessly remove steps in the first-run experience until most users hit “wow” in 3–10 minutes.  
- If model latency is high, compensate with:
  - Streaming partial results.
  - Draft previews.
  - Progress animations and clear states.

***

## Planning & Stages Toward PMF

### Stage 0 – Choose the Wedge Use Case

Winning teams start with a **sharp wedge** into a broader space:

- Cursor: AI coding inside the editor, not general developer productivity suite.
- Runway: AI video first, not “all creative tools.”
- Harvey: law firms and corporate legal, not generic document AI.
- PhotoRoom: product photos and backgrounds for e-commerce and social, not full-blown Photoshop.

**How to pick a wedge:**

- Look for workflows that are:
  - Painful and repetitive (lots of manual steps).
  - High-value (time saved is expensive; mistakes are costly).
  - Frequent enough to justify a dedicated tool.
- Confirm that users already “hack” solutions together (scripts, Excel, Zapier, manual checklists).

**Founder tasks:**

- Interview ~10–30 target users about a day/week in their life.  
- Ask them to walkthrough a recent project end-to-end, capturing every step.  
- Identify recurring pains: bottlenecks, boring steps, error-prone parts, handoffs.

***

### Stage 1 – Design a Single “Hero Workflow” End-to-End

The hero workflow is **one complete path** from intent to outcome:

- Cursor-like dev tool:
  - “Add X feature to this repo”: choose repo → describe change → AI edits → run tests → view diff → accept.

- Runway/Pika/HeyGen:
  - “Make a product demo video”: choose template → paste script → AI generates video → user tweaks clips → export.

- Harvey:
  - “Draft an NDA from a playbook”: pick template → enter parties/terms → AI drafts → lawyer reviews and edits → export to DMS.

- PhotoRoom:
  - “Create an Amazon listing image”: upload photo → auto background removal → select marketplace-ready template → export.

**Execution pattern:**

- Build a **thin but complete** hero flow:
  - Every step exists, even if some are simple or manual behind the scenes initially.
- Prioritize **quality of the end result** and **smoothness** of the flow over breadth of features.
- Accept hacky internal glue (manual QA, semi-manual review) at first, as long as the user experience is coherent.

**Questions to answer:**

- Can a first-time user complete this hero workflow with minimal guidance?  
- Did the final artifact meet a standard that your target persona would actually use in their job?

***

### Stage 2 – Iterate With Design Partners and Early Adopters

Winning teams run **tight feedback loops** with real users:

- Find 10–50 early adopters:
  - Developers or teams willing to try Cursor/Claude Code-style tools on real code.
  - Creative shops or agencies using Runway/Pika on actual client work.
  - Law firms piloting Harvey on active matters.
  - Marketing teams using Writer or Canva on real campaigns.

- Collaborate, don’t just demo:
  - Co-working sessions where you watch them work and ask them to “narrate their thoughts.”
  - Regular checkins (weekly/biweekly) where you review what they actually used your product for.

- Instrumentation:
  - Track funnel: signup → first project/workflow → first export/merge → repeat usage.
  - Log each AI task: type of task, duration, success/failure, number of retries, degree of manual editing.

**Cadence:**

- Weekly:
  - Ship changes based on observed friction.
  - Update templates, prompts, UI copy, defaults.
  - Fix rough edges that caused users to bounce.

- Monthly:
  - Review cohort retention and power-user patterns.
  - Decide whether to **go deeper** or adjust the wedge.

***

### Stage 3 – Deepen One Workflow Before Expanding

A common failure mode is **premature horizontal expansion**.

High-PMF products instead:

- Go *vertical within a workflow*:
  - Dev tools add support for more languages, frameworks, and tooling within the editor.
  - Creative tools add more control (camera, depth, style), better rendering, and collaboration on top of their initial flows.
  - Legal/enterprise tools add specialized modules for more document types, jurisdictions, and integrations into existing systems.

- Invest in **reliability and depth**:
  - Better retrieval, model fine-tuning, and evaluation.
  - Improved handling of edge cases discovered from real usage.
  - Smarter defaults that encode expertise from your best users.

**Rule of thumb:**

- Expand only when:
  - A clear majority of active users are repeatedly using one core workflow.
  - They’re asking for *adjacent* functionality that logically extends that workflow.
  - Your team is no longer constantly firefighting basic reliability issues in the core use case.

***

### Stage 4 – Packaging, Pricing, and Expansion to Teams/Enterprise

Once core PMF is visible, teams focus on **monetization and organizational adoption**:

- Packaging principles:
  - **Individual / pro plans**: enough usage and features for a power user to run serious work.
  - **Team plans**: collaboration, shared assets/templates, project workspaces.
  - **Enterprise**: SSO, SCIM, compliance, analytics, custom models, deployment options.

- Expansion patterns:
  - Figma-style: start with a few designers, then spread to PMs and engineers.
  - Notion-style: start with a team or function, then become a cross-org knowledge layer.
  - Writer/Harvey: anchor with a flagship team, then rollout to adjacent departments/offices.

**Actionable guidance:**

- Build **organizational pull**:
  - Shared libraries (styles, templates, knowledge bases).
  - Governance and admin controls.
  - Team analytics that show ROI (time saved, content produced, throughput).

***

## Metrics & Signals

### Behavioral & Financial PMF Signals

Key behavioral metrics:

- **Retention curves**:
  - Daily/weekly for high-frequency dev tools (Cursor, Claude Code).
  - Weekly/monthly for creative/enterprise tools (Runway, Harvey, Writer).
  - Healthy PMF shows curves that flatten well above zero (e.g., significantly >20–30% retained at 3–6 months, depending on category).

- **Usage depth**:
  - Time-in-product for dev/creative tools.
  - Number of completed workflows per active user (videos exported, merges applied, docs drafted).
  - Breadth of features used within the core workflow, not just logins.

- **Revenue and expansion**:
  - Net revenue retention (NRR) >100% indicates expansion from teams going deeper.
  - Seat expansion, project count expansion, or usage-based overages from organic growth.

Qualitative signals:

- Users say:
  - “I’d be very disappointed if I lost this tool.”
  - “This replaced X old tool or Y external vendor.”
  - “We’ve restructured our workflow around it.”

### AI-Specific Metrics

For AI / LLM and agent tools, track:

- **Task completion rate**  
  % of attempts where the AI-driven workflow reaches a satisfactory outcome (export, merge, accepted draft), without major manual rescue.

- **Edit distance / effort**  
  - For text/code: number of edits, changed tokens, or time spent editing after AI output.
  - For media: number of regenerations and manual overrides required.

- **Prompt-to-output time**  
  - Wall-clock time from user intent to usable result (including retries).
  - Break down by step: model time vs user decision time.

- **Autonomy rate** (for agentic workflows)  
  - % of tasks completed end-to-end by the agent with only initial instructions and approvals.
  - Track by task type; some tasks should never be fully autonomous (e.g., high-risk legal or production infra changes).

- **Trust / quality indicators**  
  - Explicit ratings (thumbs up/down, stars).
  - Error/hallucination reports.
  - Escalation to human review.

**Implementation tips:**

- Instrument each step of hero workflows and log:
  - Inputs (type, size, context length).
  - Model(s) used.
  - Number of retries, corrections, or fallbacks.
  - Final outcome type (success, partial success, failure).

***

## Distribution & Growth Patterns

### PLG and Bottom-Up Adoption

Common patterns across the named products:

- **Frictionless entry**:
  - Free tiers or trials with meaningful power (Canva, Figma, Notion, Runway/Pika, HeyGen, PhotoRoom).
  - Easy signup options; minimal setup.

- **Shareable artifacts**:
  - Output is inherently shareable and branded (videos, screenshots, design files, documents).
  - Public galleries and templates drive discovery (e.g., Canva templates, Notion pages, Figma community files).

- **Community-first distribution**:
  - Dev tools: Twitter/X demos, open-source repos, VS Code marketplace, Discord communities.
  - Creative tools: TikTok, YouTube, Instagram content tagged with the tool.
  - Vertical tools: case studies, conference talks, and thought leadership in domain-specific circles.

### Activation and Retention Loops

- **Template ecosystems**:
  - Canva/Figma/Notion show that a **template marketplace** is a distribution engine: users come for a specific template, stay for the editor.
  - AI-native tools build AI-first templates (video recipes, workflow blueprints, prompt packs).

- **Integrations**:
  - Developer tools integrate with GitHub, GitLab, CI, ticketing.
  - Creative tools plug into Adobe, editors, social schedulers.
  - Enterprise tools integrate with DMS, CRM, and internal knowledge systems.

- **Team expansion loops**:
  - One user invites colleagues to collaborate or approve work.
  - Output is shared in Slack/Teams/Notion, prompting others to adopt.
  - Administrative needs (permissions, policies) push teams to higher tiers.

**Actionable guidance:**

- Design your output so that **every artifact is an ad**:
  - Watermarks, credits, or subtle branding where acceptable.
  - Easy sharing and embedding into social or internal tools.
- Launch in the **channels where your persona lives**:
  - Dev: GitHub, Hacker News, X.
  - Creators: TikTok/YouTube/Instagram.
  - Vertical pros: LinkedIn, industry events, domain-specific communities.

***

## Common Failure Modes (and How to Avoid Them)

### 1. Thin Wrappers on Foundation Models

Failure mode:

- Generic chat UIs or “AI document editors” that do little beyond what base models offer.
- No unique data, workflows, or integration; easy to replicate.

How winners avoid it:

- Cursor/Claude Code: deep integration into development workflows, context from repos, tests, and tools.
- Harvey: firm-specific knowledge, workflows and compliance, not just generic legal Q&A.
- Writer: brand style guides, terminology governance, and enterprise connectors.

**Avoidance strategy:**

- Build **workflow and data moats**, not just UI:
  - Own the structured data: repositories, legal templates, brand kits, design systems.
  - Encode domain knowledge and rules into prompts, retrieval, and logic.

### 2. Feature Sprawl Without Depth

Failure mode:

- Many modes and buttons; none are great.
- Core workflows remain unreliable or slow; users churn from frustration.

How winners avoid it:

- They **obsess over one or two workflows** until professionals trust them for real work.
- Expansion is focused: adding depth (precision, controls, integrations) rather than random new features.

**Avoidance strategy:**

- Set a rule: no new major feature until N% of active users achieve success with the hero workflow and retention hits a target.  
- Evaluate new ideas through the lens: “Does this make the core job 2x better, or is it a distraction?”

### 3. Autonomy Theater

Failure mode:

- Overpromising “autonomous agents” that still require constant babysitting.
- Users feel lied to and lose trust.

How winners avoid it:

- They are explicit about **scope and limits** of autonomy.
- They design agents for **well-bounded tasks**:
  - E.g., Devin-style tools on constrained coding tasks, not “build arbitrary software from scratch without oversight.”
- They include **checkpoints and approvals** at critical junctures.

**Avoidance strategy:**

- Frame autonomy as **partial and assistive**, not “AI replaces your job.”  
- Start with “copilot” patterns; only add higher autonomy where behavior is predictable and testable.

### 4. Lack of Persona and JTBD Focus

Failure mode:

- Tool tries to serve too many audiences: students, prosumers, enterprises, agencies.
- Product, messaging, and pricing confuse everyone.

How winners avoid it:

- They start with a specific “tribe”:
  - Dev tools: high-intent professional developers.
  - Creative tools: specific classes of creators (social video, indie filmmakers, marketers).
  - Vertical tools: specific practice areas or departments.

**Avoidance strategy:**

- Choose a “flag-planting persona” for the first 12–18 months.  
- Say “no” to adjacent personas until there is undeniable PMF with the first.

### 5. Ignoring Trust, Safety, and Governance

Failure mode:

- Hallucinations, data leakage, inappropriate outputs.
- Enterprise buyers block adoption, or professionals won’t rely on the tool.

How winners avoid it:

- Harvey and Writer build governance, logging, redlining, and style/knowledge controls into the core product.
- Dev tools provide diffs, tests, logging, and control over changes.

**Avoidance strategy:**

- Make **safety and governance** first-class product requirements from day one if you target any professional or regulated space.  
- Provide clear language in-product about:
  - What data is stored.
  - What models are used.
  - How outputs should be reviewed.

***

## Closing Guidance for Founders

To build an AI / LLM SaaS or agent product with real PMF in 2024–2025:

1. **Pick a narrow, painful, frequent job for a specific persona.**  
2. **Design an AI-native hero workflow from intent to finished artifact.**  
3. **Make that one workflow magical, reliable, and fast** before doing anything else.  
4. **Iterate weekly with real users**, observing their actual work and instrumenting everything.  
5. **Measure PMF at the workflow level**, not just at signup or feature click level.  
6. **Design your outputs, templates, and integrations so distribution is built in.**  
7. **Avoid hype traps**: thin wrappers, feature sprawl, and autonomy theater.

If the product becomes the default way your chosen persona does that one job—and the organization around them starts adopting it almost by inertia—you’re on the right side of AI PMF.
