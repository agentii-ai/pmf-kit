# Step 7: pmf-kit Optimization Command 

pmf-kit is a good varient of spec-kit, using the same infrastructure @.specify/memory/constitution.md . I want add a new command
  called "optimize" to the project pmf-kit , to go future than spec-kit. many complex jobs requires iterative optimization of workflows and
  prompting. the "optimize" or "./pmfkit.optimize". read @refs/7_optimization.md about background information of state-of-art agent
  evaluation-suggestion-improvement stages materials. You must all use the same tech stacks / infrastructure of this current pmf-kit. add a
  plan.md of adding "optimize command" and version 0.0.4 for pmf-kit. the meaning of "optimization" have "evaluation""suggestion"and
  "improvement", also the optimization can have optional "validation" and "iteration". read @refs/7_optimization.md and more references in
  @refs/5_more/ your plan.md should focusing on how to design the pmfkit.optimize command to be able to iteratively optimize the results of
  pmf-kit. continue to optimize all templates in @.pmf/ which is real code will be packaged and released. the input output of the older version
  examples are provided in @examples/ folder. the opimize command will be more about providing a mechanism to evaluta of the pmf-kit package,
  rather than optimize a single result
