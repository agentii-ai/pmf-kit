# step 3: project management for planning

This step corresponds to the **plan.md / `/speckit.plan`** phase in Spec Kit, but focused on **PMF for an AI/LLM SaaS product**, not on implementation or technology.

Based on **Step 0–2**, you already have:

- An overview and background on PMF for AI SaaS (`step 0`)
- Principles and patterns of successful PMF (`step 1`)
- A high-level PMF spec: personas, problems, JTBD, hero workflows, success metrics, constraints (`step 2`)

Now you create a **PMF plan**: a non-technical plan.md that defines *how* you will move from idea + spec → launched product → early PMF and organic growth.

This plan should use the **best project management and growth practices** (product-led growth, growth loops, experimentation, growth hacking, and GTM discipline), but stay independent of tech stack or implementation details.

---

## 1. Objectives and time horizon

- **North star for this PMF cycle:**  
  - Example: “Prove strong PMF for [hero workflow] with [persona] within [N] months.”

- **Time horizon:**  
  - Define length of this PMF plan (e.g., 3, 6, or 9 months).

- **Key outcomes for this period:**  
  - Behavioral PMF signals you want to see.  
  - Business signals (e.g., paid users, expansion, strong usage cohorts).  
  - Learning milestones (e.g., which persona/wedge is best, which channels work).

## 2. Strategy: wedge, positioning, and growth thesis

Summarize your **strategic choices** based on step 2:

- **Wedge use case and hero workflow:**  
  - Which workflow are you betting PMF on first?  
  - Why this wedge (pain intensity, frequency, budget, ecosystem fit)?

- **Positioning & narrative:**  
  - One-line product positioning for the primary persona (problem → solution → outcome).  
  - Short story that explains how your product fits into their current workflow and replaces/augments existing tools.

- **Growth thesis:**  
  - How you believe this product will grow **if PMF is real**:  
    - Product-led growth via self-serve and collaboration?  
    - Social/viral effects from public outputs?  
    - Community and content (YouTube, Twitter/X, Reddit, open templates)?

## 3. Launch and activation plan

Plan how you will get the **first real users** into the hero workflow.

### 3.1 Entry points and channels (pre-PMF)

List your top 3–5 **initial channels** and why they fit your persona:

- Examples:  
  - **Twitter/X:** dev and AI communities, build-in-public, demos.  
  - **Reddit:** subreddit communities (e.g., r/MachineLearning, r/SaaS, domain-specific subs).  
  - **Product Hunt:** launch day spike + early adopters.  
  - **LinkedIn:** B2B, vertical professionals, thought leadership.  
  - **Discord/Slack community:** owned channel for engaged users.  
  - **Cold outreach / design partners:** targeted outreach to ideal users.

For each chosen channel, define:

- Target persona on that channel.  
- Type of message and content that will resonate (problem story, before/after demo, case study, build-in-public thread).  
- Expected scale (dozens vs hundreds vs thousands of leads).

### 3.2 Onboarding and first-run experience

Design a **first-run experience** that maximizes:

- **Time to first value (TTFV)** and **time to first wow (TTFW)** for your hero workflow.  
- Clarity: users quickly understand what the product does and for whom.  
- Minimal friction: as few steps as possible to run the hero workflow once.

Specify:

- What the user sees and does in the **first 5 minutes**.  
- What input they use (their own data, sample data, templates).  
- How you nudge them to run the **hero workflow** end-to-end.

## 4. Experiment roadmap (PMF cycles)

Treat PMF as a series of **experiments and learning cycles**, not a single launch.

### 4.1 Hypotheses and experiments

Based on your spec and strategy, list key hypotheses in three groups:

- **Persona & problem fit** (e.g., “Senior backend engineers in 20–200 person SaaS companies feel acute pain doing X without good tools.”)
- **Workflow & product fit** (e.g., “If given [input], they can complete [hero workflow] and call it ‘good enough’ within Y minutes.”)
- **Channel & growth fit** (e.g., “We can consistently find new high-intent users via [channel] with acceptable cost/effort.”)

For each hypothesis, define 1–3 experiments:

- Target users and channel.  
- What you will change: onboarding, messaging, workflow, pricing test, etc.  
- What success looks like (metrics / qualitative outcomes).  
- Timebox and sample size.

### 4.2 PMF sprints and cadence

Define an **operating cadence** for the PMF plan:

- **Weekly:**  
  - Review key metrics: activation, retention, workflow completion, qualitative feedback.  
  - Plan and ship small product/UX/growth experiments.  
  - Talk to several users (live sessions or async videos/logs).

- **Monthly:**  
  - Step back to evaluate whether your wedge, persona, or channel needs adjustment.  
  - Decide whether to double down, pivot wedge, or test a new segment.

## 5. Growth loops and virality

Plan how growth will become **self-reinforcing** instead of purely manual.

### 5.1 Core growth loops

Define 1–2 loops that could drive compounding growth if PMF is strong, for example:

- **Output → audience → new users loop**  
  - Users create content (videos, screenshots, designs, documents).  
  - Content is shared on X, TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, etc.  
  - Viewers see your watermark/brand and click through.  
  - New users sign up and repeat.

- **Collaboration loop**  
  - One user invites teammates/clients to view/comment/edit.  
  - Those collaborators create their own content or projects.  
  - Teams standardize on the tool.

- **Template/community loop**  
  - Power users create templates/workflows/public spaces.  
  - Others use and adapt them.  
  - The best templates attract more users and content.

For each loop, specify:

- Trigger action (what starts the loop).  
- Key steps and surfaces (e.g., sharing, invites, templates).  
- How you will instrument and optimize the loop.

### 5.2 Social media and community tactics

Outline practical tactics per channel (keep it strategic, not daily posting details):

- **Twitter/X:** build in public, product threads, user success stories, founder voice.
- **Reddit:** authentic participation in relevant subs; case studies, AMAs, showing work. Avoid spam.
- **Product Hunt:** launch strategy; follow-up launches (feature launch, v2) if appropriate.
- **LinkedIn:** long-form posts and carousels on use cases and ROI; customer stories; founder/operator insights.
- **YouTube/TikTok:** demos, tutorials, before/after transformations.

Tie each tactic back to your **growth loops** and PMF hypotheses.

## 6. Measurement and dashboards

Define what you will **measure weekly** to track PMF progress, at a planning level (no implementation detail):

- **Acquisition:**  
  - Signups by channel (X, Reddit, PH, LinkedIn, referrals).  
  - Conversion from visitor → signup.

- **Activation:**  
  - % of new users who complete hero workflow within 7 days.  
  - TTFW (median, p90) for hero workflow.

- **Engagement & retention:**  
  - Weekly/monthly active users focused on hero workflows.  
  - Cohort retention curves by acquisition channel and persona.

- **PMF & value signals:**  
  - “Very disappointed if you could no longer use this” responses.  
  - Qualitative quotes showing the product is replacing old tools/processes.  
  - Early revenue: conversion to paid, upgrades, expansions.

For the plan, specify **which metrics you will track and how often**. The actual dashboard implementation lives elsewhere; this document sets expectations.

## 7. Risks, guardrails, and decision checkpoints

Document risks already identified in Step 2 and tie them to **plan-level guardrails**:

- **User and market risks** (wrong persona, wrong wedge, niche too small).  
  - Checkpoints: by when do you expect strong signals from current persona/wedge? What threshold means “try a new wedge”?

- **Trust & safety risks** (hallucinations, data/privacy, misuse).  
  - Guardrails at plan level: which workflows require extra review; what you will not automate.

- **Growth risks** (over-reliance on one channel, vanity metrics).  
  - Guardrails: avoid equating launch spikes (Product Hunt, X viral thread) with PMF; focus on retention and workflow depth.

Define **explicit decision points** in time where you will:

- Continue with current strategy.  
- Adjust persona, wedge, or hero workflow.  
- Change or expand acquisition channels.  
- Re-scope the product.

## Perplexity research prompt

Use the prompt below in Perplexity (or similar tools) to gather **best-practice planning and growth methods** for taking an AI/LLM SaaS product from idea/spec to PMF and early organic growth.

```prompt
you are an expert product leader and growth operator for ai/llm saas and agent products, working in 2023–2025.

based on this context:

- i already have: an overview of pmf for ai saas, principles and patterns of successful pmf, and a non-technical pmf spec (personas, problems, jobs-to-be-done, hero workflows, constraints, success metrics).
- i now want to create a **plan.md** focused on project management and growth, not on tech stack or implementation details.

please extensively research recent (2023–2025) best practices, case studies, and playbooks on **planning and driving pmf for ai/llm saas products**, especially those that use:

- product-led growth and self-serve onboarding
- growth loops (content, templates, collaboration, referrals)
- social and community-driven growth (twitter/x, reddit, product hunt, linkedin, youtube, tiktok, discord)
- experimentation and pmf sprints (hypothesis-driven, weekly/monthly cadences)

focus on concrete examples and sources from products like cursor, claude code, devin, manus, lovable.dev, runway, pika, heygen, photoroom, harvey, writer.ai, canva, figma, notion, and similar tools with visible pmf.

for each relevant source or product, extract:

1. how they structured their early **launch and activation plan** (personas, channels, onboarding)
2. how they defined and measured **activation, retention, and pmf** (especially workflow-level metrics)
3. what **growth loops** or viral mechanisms they relied on (content, templates, collaboration, integrations, referrals)
4. how they ran **experiments** and made decisions to double down, pivot wedges, or change channels
5. any published frameworks or checklists for planning pmf cycles for ai saas

then synthesize these findings into a planning playbook tailored for my context, including:

- a proposed structure for a non-technical **pmf plan.md** (objectives, strategy, launch/activation, experiments, growth loops, metrics, risks)
- concrete recommendations for how to use channels like twitter/x, reddit, product hunt, linkedin, and others for early pmf work (with examples)
- example "pmf sprints" or cycles (e.g., 4–6 week plans) that combine product improvements, user research, and growth experiments

present the answer as a markdown document i can adapt directly into `step 3: project management for planning` in my pmf-kit.
```



# plan.md – Project Management & Growth Plan for AI/LLM PMF (2023–2025 Playbook)

## 0. Cross-cutting patterns from recent AI/LLM PMF successes

Across Cursor, Claude Code, Devin-style agents, Lovable.dev, Runway, Pika, HeyGen, PhotoRoom, Harvey, Writer, Canva, Figma, Notion, and similar products (2023–2025), the PMF *planning and growth* patterns look like this:

- **Product-led first, distribution-aware from day one**  
  - Self-serve onboarding with real power in the free tier or trial.  
  - A clear “aha” or “wow” moment tied to a specific workflow, not generic chat.  
  - Low friction to install/try (e.g., Cursor’s VS Code-like UX + instant download).

- **Workflow-level activation and retention metrics**  
  - Activation defined as “completed hero workflow” (e.g., exported video, merged PR, finished contract draft), not just “signed up.”  
  - Retention measured around recurring use of those workflows (e.g., weekly coding sessions, campaigns, docs).

- **Growth loops embedded in the product**  
  - Shareable artifacts (videos, screenshots, docs, designs).  
  - Template ecosystems and public galleries.  
  - Collaboration and team workflows that naturally pull in more users.

- **Community and social channels as PMF instruments, not just marketing**  
  - Founders and teams very active on Twitter/X, Discord, GitHub, Product Hunt, YouTube, TikTok, Reddit, LinkedIn, etc.  
  - “Building in public,” shipping frequently, and using user stories as experiments.

- **Short, intense PMF sprints**  
  - 4–6 week cycles combining: product changes to hero workflows, onboarding tweaks, growth experiments in 1–2 channels, and deep user research.  
  - Decisions to double down, refine, or pivot wedges are made from these cycles.

The rest of this document is structured so you can drop it directly into `step 3: project management for planning` in your PMF kit.

***

## 1. Structure for a non-technical pmf plan.md

Use this as the top-level structure:

1. Objectives & North Star  
2. Strategy & Wedge  
3. Launch & Activation Plan  
4. Growth Loops & Channels  
5. PMF Metrics & Instrumentation  
6. PMF Sprints (4–6 week cycles)  
7. Risks, Constraints & Guardrails  
8. Operating Rhythm & Roles

### 1.1 Objectives & North Star

Define:

- **North Star outcome**  
  - One sentence: “Become the default way [primary persona] does [hero job] for [segment].”
- **12–18 month objectives (non-technical):**
  - Example:
    - Reach X weekly active users who complete hero workflow A at least Y times/week.
    - Achieve Z% of active users saying they’d be “very disappointed” if they lost the product.
    - Reach N paying teams/accounts with expansion revenue (not just solo users).

### 1.2 Strategy & Wedge

Summarize:

- Primary persona & segment (from your spec).  
- Core problems & JTBD.  
- 1–2 hero workflows that this PMF plan will focus on.  
- Deliberately *out-of-scope* users and workflows for this phase.

***

## 2. Launch & Activation Plan (Patterns from Successful AI SaaS)

This section is about *how you get the right people into the product and to first value*.

### 2.1 How others structured their early launch/activation

Condensed patterns:

- **Cursor (developer AI IDE)**  
  - Persona: professional developers already in VS Code-like IDEs.  
  - Channels: founder presence and demos on X; dev communities (HN, GitHub), word-of-mouth; zero paid ads.  
  - Onboarding:
    - Instant download, VS Code-like UI (zero learning curve).
    - Generous free tier (thousands of completions) so devs could feel real value on their own projects.
    - “Wow moment” design: fix a bug or implement a feature with one natural-language prompt; explain existing code instantly.
  - Activation definition:
    - Installed → opened on real repo → AI used to change/understand code → change accepted/merged.

- **Runway / Pika / HeyGen / PhotoRoom (creative & media)**  
  - Persona: creators, marketers, small teams with recurrent video/image output needs.  
  - Channels: TikTok, YouTube, X, creator communities, product launches.  
  - Onboarding:
    - Web signup with simple flows: upload asset or start from prompt/template.
    - Instant visible results (e.g., text-to-video preview, background removal).
  - Activation definition:
    - New user who *exports* a first video/image that meets their own use bar.

- **Harvey / Writer (vertical & enterprise)**  
  - Persona: lawyers and enterprise content teams within specific firms/companies.  
  - Channels: warm intros, early design partners, case studies, conferences, targeted LinkedIn and network effects within firms.  
  - Onboarding:
    - Hands-on onboarding with selected teams.
    - Import of firm/company knowledge and templates.
    - Training on a small set of high-value use cases.
  - Activation definition:
    - Professionals using the tool on *real* matters or campaigns (not just sandbox tests).

- **Canva / Figma / Notion (iconic PLG)**  
  - Persona: non-designers (Canva), designers and PMs (Figma), teams needing flexible docs (Notion).  
  - Channels: self-serve signup, templates and galleries, word-of-mouth.  
  - Onboarding:
    - Start from a template (presentation, social graphic, landing page, wiki, meeting notes).
    - Very clear first action (edit text, drop an image, drag-and-drop UI).
  - Activation definition:
    - Created and shared/used at least one meaningful document/design/space.

### 2.2 Your launch & activation section template

In your `plan.md`, create:

- **Target personas & segments (for this phase)**  
  - Which slice are you *deliberately* optimizing for at launch?

- **Entry points & first-touch channels**
  - Example:
    - Dev tools: X (founder account), HN posts, GitHub README, dev Discord, VS Code marketplace.  
    - Creative: TikTok/YouTube short demos, creator newsletters, design communities.  
    - Vertical: targeted LinkedIn outreach, domain Slack communities, intros via advisors.

- **Onboarding narrative**
  - “When [persona] clicks in from [channel], what do they see and do in the first 5 minutes?”
  - Define:
    - Landing page promise (one-line value).
    - Onboarding path (signup → connect [asset/repo/docs] → run hero workflow).
    - “Wow moment” for each persona.

- **Activation criteria**
  - Define for each hero workflow:
    - Activation event: “User has done X with their own data at least once.”
      - E.g., “Ran AI to modify their own repo and applied a change,” “Exported a video/image they could publish,” “Drafted and edited a real contract/asset.”

***

## 3. PMF Metrics & Instrumentation (Activation, Retention, PMF)

### 3.1 How others defined and measured

Common patterns:

- **Activation (workflow-level)**  
  - Cursor-style: IDE install + open real project + AI-generated changes accepted or merged.  
  - Creative tools: first export of usable asset (image/video/audio).  
  - Vertical tools: first draft/review used in real work.

- **Retention**  
  - Weekly or monthly *workflow* recurrence:
    - Dev: coding with AI assistance multiple times/week.
    - Creators: weekly exports.
    - Teams: at least one project/week or doc/week.

- **PMF signals**  
  - Behavior:
    - Healthy retention curves by cohorts of *activated* users.
    - Growing % of users who run hero workflows repeatedly.
  - Qualitative:
    - “Very disappointed if product disappeared.”
    - Evidence of replacement: “We stopped using X,” “We canceled Y agency/tool.”
  - Business:
    - Willingness to pay out-of-pocket (dev tools, creators).
    - Expansion of seats/usage within teams/firms.

### 3.2 Metrics section for your plan.md

Add a structured metrics block:

- **Activation metrics**
  - % of signups who reach activation event for hero workflow A within 7 days.  
  - Median time-to-activation (TTFW) for A.  
  - Same for hero workflow B (if any).

- **Engagement & retention**
  - Weekly active users (WAU) *who run a hero workflow*.  
  - Avg hero workflows per active user per week.  
  - 4-week and 12-week retention of *activated* users.

- **AI/agent quality**
  - Task completion rate for key workflows.  
  - Edit effort (e.g., heavy/light, measured qualitatively at first).  
  - Latency (user-perceived, not just model).

- **Business/PMF**
  - Conversion to paid among activated users.  
  - ARPU/expansion signals once teams appear.  
  - Qualitative PMF surveys (e.g., Sean Ellis question quarterly on activated cohort).

***

## 4. Growth Loops & Viral Mechanisms

### 4.1 Patterns from leading products

- **Content & social loops (Cursor, Pika, Runway, HeyGen, PhotoRoom, Notion)**  
  - Users sharing what they built:
    - Cursor: “look, AI fixed my bug,” “I shipped X in an afternoon.”  
    - Pika/Runway/HeyGen: clips, ads, explainers go on X/TikTok/YouTube.  
    - PhotoRoom: before/after product images.  
    - Notion/Canva/Figma: templates and public docs/designs.

- **Template & gallery loops**  
  - Canva/Figma/Notion: template libraries and community galleries become:
    - Acquisition channels (people search “X template” and discover product).  
    - Activation accelerators (no blank page).

- **Collaboration loops**  
  - Figma: multi-player design; invites designers and PMs.  
  - Notion: shared docs and team spaces.  
  - AI products:
    - Team projects with sharable links and comments.  
    - Legal/content review workflows pulling reviewers in.

- **Integration loops**  
  - Connect to tools people already use (GitHub, Slack, Notion, Google Docs, etc.).  
  - The more integrated, the higher switching cost and apparent value.

### 4.2 Growth loops section for your plan.md

Define 2–3 deliberate loops:

- **Loop 1: Artifact sharing loop**
  - Artifact: what users produce (code diffs, screenshots, videos, docs).  
  - Where shared: X, Reddit, TikTok, LinkedIn, internal Slack/Teams.  
  - How you support it:
    - Easy export with subtle branding.  
    - Simple share buttons and guidance in onboarding (“Show your result on X; tag us”).  
    - Occasional contests or highlight threads.

- **Loop 2: Template loop**
  - Seed templates created by you.  
  - Plan to source templates from power users.  
  - Mechanism to surface the best templates and let people start from them.

- **Loop 3: Collaboration loop (if relevant)**
  - Define core collaboration scenario (e.g., “dev shares AI-produced diff with teammate,” “marketer sends AI-drafted doc to approver”).  
  - Decide what “invite” flows and sharing primitives you need to support early (link share, comments, assignments).

Each loop in the plan should specify:

- Trigger: what in-product event kicks off the loop.  
- User action: what the user does next.  
- External surface: where others see it (X, Slack, etc.).  
- Return path: how observers end up in your product.  

***

## 5. Channels: How to Use X, Reddit, PH, LinkedIn, etc. for PMF

### 5.1 Twitter/X

- **For dev and AI-native audiences (Cursor, dev tools, Pika/Runway)**  
  - Founders share:
    - Short demos of hero workflows using *realistic* problems.  
    - Before/after clips or screenshots.  
    - Roadmap updates and “we shipped X today” posts.  
  - Engage:
    - Reply to users who mention your product.  
    - Amplify user stories (“shipped this in 1 day with [tool]”).  
    - Participate in broader conversations (AI agents, coding, creator workflows).

Tactics:

- Ship threads that show: “Here’s how [persona] does [job] in 2 minutes with [product].”  
- Pin a concise onboarding tweet that points to a simple landing page/demo.  
- DM high-fit users (judiciously) to get them into early cohorts or design partner programs.

### 5.2 Reddit

- Best for honest, non-sales content in relevant subreddits (e.g., r/programming, r/MachineLearning, r/VideoEditing, r/Entrepreneur).  
- Post:
  - Case studies or “here’s what we learned building an AI tool for X persona.”  
  - Detailed walkthroughs of workflows (no fluff, heavy on screenshots or explanations).  
- Use comments to discuss trade-offs, limitations, and roadmap.

Tactics:

- Avoid promo; focus on “we built this for [exacting use case], here’s what worked and what didn’t.”  
- Use AMA-style threads for early users.

### 5.3 Product Hunt

- Good for initial awareness and early adopter intake; not a PMF proof by itself.  
- Prepare:
  - Clear positioning and hero workflow pitch.  
  - Short video/gif showing your best 20–30 seconds.  
  - Landing page specifically tuned to PH traffic (curious builders, not necessarily your final ICP).

Tactics:

- Use PH launch as an **experiment**:
  - Which segments sign up?  
  - Which messages resonate?  
- Have a structured plan to talk to 20–50 of the most promising signups in the following 2 weeks.

### 5.3 LinkedIn

- More effective for vertical and enterprise tools (Harvey, Writer, B2B copilots) and for PLG tools entering teams.  
- Share:
  - Case studies from design partners.  
  - Thought leadership on the domain (legal, marketing, ops) and how AI is changing workflows.  
  - Screenshots/gifs, but anchored in business outcomes.

Tactics:

- Ask champions at early companies to engage with posts (e.g., like/comment how they use the product).  
- Use LinkedIn DMs sparingly to invite domain experts/users into closed pilots.

### 5.4 YouTube, TikTok, Discord, others

- **YouTube/TikTok**:
  - For creative tools, these are core: tutorials, breakdowns, workflow examples.  
  - For dev tools: coding sessions, “building X in Y minutes” content.

- **Discord**:
  - Acts as your always-on lab:
    - Users share issues, feature requests, and wins.  
    - You can recruit testers for experiments.  
  - Moderation and founder presence are key.

***

## 6. PMF Sprints: Example 4–6 Week Cycles

Design PMF work as repeating cycles. Each cycle combines:

- Product improvements to hero workflows.  
- Onboarding tweaks and UX changes.  
- Growth experiments in 1–2 channels.  
- User research and metrics review.

### 6.1 Example 6-week PMF sprint (dev-tool flavor)

**Week 0 (prep)**  
- Choose:
  - 1 hero workflow: e.g., “Implement a feature from a GitHub issue.”  
  - 1–2 channels: e.g., X and GitHub community.  
- Define:
  - Activation: user completes that workflow once on their own repo.  
  - Targets: e.g., 30% of new signups reach activation in 7 days.

**Weeks 1–2: Activation & Onboarding**

- Product:
  - Simplify onboarding path to hero workflow (one-click start from demo repo + banner to “connect your own repo”).  
  - Add in-product guidance for that workflow only.

- Growth:
  - 2–3 X posts/week showing realistic “issue → PR” runs.  
  - Reach out to 10–20 devs behind interesting repos; offer early access with hands-on help.

- Research:
  - 5–10 user calls focused only on:
    - Where onboarding breaks.  
    - Whether workflow meets their bar.

**Weeks 3–4: Quality & Depth**

- Product:
  - Fix top friction points from calls and metrics (e.g., AI misunderstanding instructions, poor diffs).  
  - Add small guardrails (e.g., clear preview before applying large changes).

- Growth:
  - Encourage early users to share their success stories on X/Reddit.  
  - Curate a small gallery of “cool things built” as social proof.

- Metrics:
  - Review activation trends and first retention signals.

**Weeks 5–6: Decision & Next Bet**

- Decide:
  - Double down: if activation and early retention are promising, keep deepening the workflow.  
  - Adjust wedge: if workflows are too broad, narrow them.  
  - Adjust channel: if X is noisy but GitHub issues content works better, pivot focus.

- Plan next sprint:
  - Either deepen the same workflow (more languages, more integrations).  
  - Or add a second closely adjacent workflow (e.g., “refactor legacy module”).

### 6.2 Example 4-week PMF sprint (creative/media flavor)

**Week 1**  
- Goal: increase % of new users who export at least one usable video/image.  
- Actions:
  - Simplify template selection to 3–5 high-performing templates.  
  - On TikTok/YouTube, post “before/after” videos focused on one template.

**Week 2**  
- 10 user interviews with recent signups who *didn’t* export anything.  
- Implement top 3 onboarding fixes (copy, sample content, default prompt).

**Week 3**  
- Run a “Share your first [artifact]” challenge on X/TikTok with a small reward or feature.  
- Add share buttons and subtle branding to exports.

**Week 4**  
- Review changes in activation and export rates.  
- Decide whether to:
  - Enrich the top templates.  
  - Or introduce a new, closely-related template-based workflow.

***

## 7. Risks, Constraints & Guardrails (for PMF Planning)

Include a non-technical risk section linked to PMF, not implementation:

- **Persona risk**: chasing too many audiences at once.  
  - Mitigation: each sprint explicitly targeted to one persona and one JTBD.

- **Workflow risk**: hero workflows not actually “heroic.”  
  - Mitigation: validate with real users that this job is frequent, painful, high-value.

- **Channel risk**: over-investing in vanity channel wins (e.g., launch days) without retention.  
  - Mitigation: every channel experiment judged on how many *activated* users it produces, not signups or upvotes.

- **Trust/safety risk**: early negative experiences due to hallucinations or bad outputs.  
  - Mitigation: clear guardrails, disclaimers, and conservative defaults in early high-stakes workflows.

***

## 8. Operating Rhythm & Roles

Define how the team will run PMF work:

- **Weekly**  
  - One PMF meeting:
    - Review activation, workflow runs, and key support issues.  
    - Decide 1–3 changes to ship that week.  
  - Ship small UX/onboarding/product improvements.

- **Bi-weekly**  
  - 5–10 user conversations.  
  - Update your understanding of personas and JTBD.

- **Per sprint (4–6 weeks)**  
  - Pick 1–2 hypotheses:
    - About a workflow (e.g., “shortening step X will improve activation by Y%”).  
    - About a channel (e.g., “targeted X threads → more high-intent signups than PH”).  
  - Run experiments, then decide whether to double down, adjust, or drop.

Roles (can be people wearing multiple hats in a small team):

- Product lead: owns hero workflows and PMF strategy.  
- Growth/ops: owns channels, experiments, analytics.  
- UX/Design: owns onboarding, clarity, and the “wow moment.”  
- Domain expert (if vertical): validates real-world value and risks.
