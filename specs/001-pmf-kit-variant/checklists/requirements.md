- [x] Templates adapted for PMF discovery (research methods, not code architecture)
- [x] Constitution references PMF-specific principles (Customer-Evidence-Driven, Iterative Validation, Minimal Viable Process)
- [x] Risks include common AI PMF failure modes (thin wrapper, feature sprawl, autonomy theater, persona dilution)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary PMF discovery flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - Specification optimized for AI SaaS PMF discovery with extensive references to successful products (Cursor, Claude Code, Devin, Runway, Pika, HeyGen, Harvey, Writer, PhotoRoom, Canva, Figma, Notion). Focus on learning objectives, customer evidence, and behavioral metrics rather than technical implementation.

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASS** - Enhanced to 34 functional requirements covering:
- FR-001 to FR-014: CLI and agent namespace isolation
- FR-015 to FR-023: Template adaptation with PMF-specific structure (7 sections per spec)
- FR-024 to FR-028: Installation compatibility
- FR-029 to FR-034: PMF-specific workflow features (AI-native patterns, guardrails, evidence collection)

### Success Criteria Review
✅ **PASS** - Expanded to 14 success criteria organized by category:
- Installation & Tooling (SC-001 to SC-003): Multi-kit coexistence, 2-minute initialization
- Specification Quality (SC-004 to SC-006): PMF-specific sections, sharp personas, AI-native hero workflows
- PMF Discovery Efficiency (SC-007 to SC-009): 70% time reduction, AI-specific metrics, pattern references
- Template Extensibility (SC-010 to SC-012): 3+ kit variants, 8-hour variant creation, zero namespace collisions
- Workflow Completion (SC-013 to SC-014): 90% completion rate, research artifacts validation

### AI SaaS PMF Focus Review (New)
✅ **PASS** - User Story 3 enhanced with detailed PMF-specific acceptance scenarios:
1. Spec sections match modern AI SaaS patterns (7 required sections)
2. Personas include role/skill, company context, tool stack (not generic descriptions)
3. JTBD uses job story format with workarounds and "10x better" definitions
4. Hero workflows include TTFW targets, quality bars, user/AI responsibilities
5. Success metrics span activation, engagement, AI-specific, and business categories
6. Constraints section addresses latency, compliance, unit economics
7. Risks section covers "wrapper risk", "autonomy theater", "trust/hallucination"

### Template Structure Review (New)
✅ **PASS** - Functional requirements FR-015 to FR-023 specify:
- 7-section spec structure (Personas, JTBD, Hero Workflows, Metrics, Constraints, Distribution, Questions)
- Hero workflow patterns from successful products (Cursor, Runway, Harvey, PhotoRoom/Canva styles)
- AI-specific metrics (completion rate, edit effort, prompt-to-output time, autonomy rate, trust indicators)
- PMF risk mitigation strategies (avoiding thin wrappers, feature sprawl, autonomy theater, persona dilution)
- Examples from 11 successful AI products throughout templates

### Key Entities Review (New)
✅ **PASS** - Expanded from 8 to 14 key entities with PMF-specific definitions:
- Added: Target Persona, Target Segment, JTBD, Hero Workflow (with AI product examples)
- Added: PMF Signal, PMF Risk, Distribution Hypothesis (with concrete patterns)
- All entities include concrete examples and measurable characteristics

## Notes

All checklist items passed validation. Specification has been **significantly enhanced** for AI SaaS PMF discovery focus.

**Major Improvements in This Optimization**:

1. **User Story 3 Enhancement**: Expanded from 4 to 7 acceptance scenarios covering all PMF-specific sections
2. **Functional Requirements**: Increased from 29 to 34 FRs with detailed PMF template structure
3. **Success Criteria**: Expanded from 9 to 14 SCs organized into 5 categories with specific metrics
4. **Key Entities**: Expanded from 8 to 14 entities with PMF-specific definitions and examples
5. **AI Product References**: Added 11 successful AI products as concrete examples (Cursor, Claude Code, Devin, Lovable, Runway, Pika, HeyGen, Descript, Harvey, Writer, PhotoRoom)
6. **Hero Workflow Patterns**: Specified 4 distinct patterns (dev tools, creative tools, vertical tools, PLG tools)
7. **AI-Specific Metrics**: Added task completion rate, edit effort, prompt-to-output time, autonomy rate, TTFW
8. **PMF Risk Framework**: Added 5 common failure modes with mitigation strategies

**Spec Now Ready For**: `/pmfkit.plan` (recommended next step)

**Key Strengths**:
- Deeply grounded in 2024-2025 AI SaaS PMF best practices
- Concrete examples from successful products at every level
- Clear distinction between PMF discovery and software development
- Comprehensive namespace isolation strategy
- Strong foundation for variant creation (pd-kit, marketing-kit, biz-writing-kit)

**Recommendations for Planning Phase**:
- Reference /refs/2_define_for_specify.md structure when creating plan-template.md
- Include hero workflow research methods (co-working sessions, instrumentation, TTFW measurement)
- Specify PMF-specific risk mitigation approaches (workflow moats, depth-first expansion, persona focus)
- Design distribution mechanisms (shareable artifacts, template ecosystems, team expansion loops)
