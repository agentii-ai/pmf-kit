# Feature Specification: Automated Template Release Generation

**Feature Branch**: `002-automated-template-releases`
**Created**: 2025-12-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Automated template release generation for multiple AI agents similar to Spec-Kit's release process

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Release Manager Creates New PMF-Kit Release (Priority: P1)

A PMF-Kit maintainer wants to create a new release with templates for all supported AI agents (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini, Copilot, Qoder, etc.) using both bash and PowerShell script variants. They should be able to trigger the release process that automatically generates 36 template ZIP files and publishes them to GitHub releases.

**Why this priority**: This is the core capability that enables PMF-Kit to have its own releases and stop relying on Spec-Kit template fallback.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering the release workflow, verifying all 36 ZIP files are generated correctly, and confirming the GitHub release is published with proper naming and versioning.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the maintainer has merged changes to main branch, **When** they create a new version tag (e.g., `v0.1.0`), **Then** the automated workflow triggers and generates all template variants
2. **Given** the workflow is running, **When** it processes each agent/script combination, **Then** it creates correctly structured ZIP files with PMF-Kit branding and `/pmfkit.*` commands
3. **Given** all templates are generated, **When** the workflow publishes the release, **Then** a GitHub release appears with all 36 ZIP files attached and proper release notes
4. **Given** a release is published, **When** users run `pmf init my-project`, **Then** the CLI downloads templates from pmf-kit releases (not spec-kit fallback)

---

### User Story 2 - Developer Tests Template Generation Locally (Priority: P2)

A developer wants to test template generation locally before pushing changes, ensuring their modifications to templates or scripts work correctly across all agent/script combinations.

**Why this priority**: Enables rapid iteration and validation without waiting for CI/CD, reducing the feedback loop for template development.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the local build script and verifying all template ZIPs are created in the dist/ directory with correct structure and content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer has modified templates, **When** they run `./scripts/build-templates.sh`, **Then** all 36 template variants are generated locally in `dist/templates/`
2. **Given** templates are built locally, **When** the developer inspects a ZIP file, **Then** it contains the correct directory structure with agent-specific commands and PMF-Kit branding
3. **Given** a build completes, **When** errors occur in any template, **Then** the script reports which template failed and provides actionable error messages
4. **Given** local testing is complete, **When** the developer commits changes, **Then** CI validation runs the same build process to catch issues before release

---

### User Story 3 - CI System Validates Template Integrity (Priority: P2)

The continuous integration system should validate that all templates are correctly formatted, contain required files, and have proper PMF-Kit branding before allowing merge to main.

**Why this priority**: Prevents broken or incomplete templates from being released, maintaining quality standards.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering CI on a pull request and verifying it checks for required files, validates command references, and ensures no Spec-Kit references remain.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pull request modifies templates, **When** CI runs validation, **Then** it verifies all templates contain required files (commands, scripts, constitution)
2. **Given** CI is validating templates, **When** it finds `/speckit.*` references that should be `/pmfkit.*`, **Then** the build fails with clear error messages
3. **Given** CI validation passes, **When** templates are generated, **Then** automated tests extract and verify the structure of each ZIP file
4. **Given** all validations pass, **When** maintainer merges the PR, **Then** the changes are ready for the next release

### Edge Cases

- What happens if a template ZIP fails to generate for one agent but succeeds for others?
- How does the system handle version numbering when multiple releases happen on the same day?
- What if the GitHub API rate limit is exceeded during release publication?
- How are templates validated to ensure no Spec-Kit references remain?
- What happens if the release workflow is triggered but no templates have changed?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Template Generation

- **FR-001**: System MUST generate template variants for all 18 supported AI agents: claude, cursor-agent, windsurf, gemini, copilot, qoder, qwen, opencode, codex, kilocode, auggie, codebuddy, amp, shai, q (Amazon Q), bob, roo

### Key Entities

- **Template Variant**: A combination of agent type and script type (e.g., claude-sh, cursor-ps), resulting in 36 unique variants
- **Agent Configuration**: Metadata for each supported agent including name, command directory name, and whether it requires CLI tools
- **Template ZIP**: A compressed archive containing all files needed for a specific agent/script combination
- **Release Asset**: A ZIP file attached to a GitHub release with versioned naming and SHA-256 checksum
- **Build Manifest**: JSON file documenting all generated templates with metadata (agent, script, size, checksum, timestamp)
- **Template Base**: Source directory structure containing PMF-Kit specific files before agent/script customization
- **Command File**: Markdown file with YAML frontmatter that defines a `/pmfkit.*` slash command for AI agents

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

#### Release Automation Success

- **SC-001**: Maintainer can create a new release by creating a version tag, with full automation completing in under 10 minutes
- **SC-002**: Each release generates exactly 36 template ZIP files (18 agents × 2 script types) with correct naming and structure
- **SC-003**: GitHub release page displays all templates with proper versioning, release notes, and SHA-256 checksums
- **SC-004**: After release, `pmf init` command successfully downloads templates from pmf-kit repository (not spec-kit fallback)

#### Template Quality

- **SC-005**: 100% of generated templates pass validation checks: correct structure, required files present, no Spec-Kit references
- **SC-006**: All templates contain `/pmfkit.*` command references (zero `/speckit.*` references remain)
- **SC-007**: Each template includes PMF-Kit constitution v1.0.0 with 7 PMF-specific principles
- **SC-008**: Templates extract successfully and create functional PMF projects when used with `pmf init`

#### Developer Experience

- **SC-009**: Developers can build all templates locally in under 5 minutes using `./scripts/build-templates.sh`
- **SC-010**: Local builds produce identical results to CI builds (byte-for-byte reproducible)
- **SC-011**: CI validation catches template issues before merge, with 95% of problems detected before release
- **SC-012**: Build script provides clear progress indicators and actionable error messages when failures occur

#### Maintainability

- **SC-013**: Adding a new AI agent requires modifying only the AGENTS array in build script (under 5 lines of code)
- **SC-014**: Template structure changes automatically propagate to all 36 variants without manual editing
- **SC-015**: Release process is fully automated with zero manual steps required after tag creation
- **SC-016**: All workflows and scripts are documented with inline comments explaining each step

## Out of Scope *(optional)*
