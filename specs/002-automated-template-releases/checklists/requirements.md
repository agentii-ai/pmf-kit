# Specification Quality Checklist: Automated Template Release Generation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-03
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All specification quality criteria pass. The spec is ready for planning phase (`/pmfkit.plan`).

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear user stories with independent testability
- Comprehensive functional requirements (26 total covering all aspects)
- Measurable success criteria (16 criteria covering automation, quality, DX, maintainability)
- Well-defined scope with explicit out-of-scope items
- Detailed dependencies, assumptions, and constraints

**No issues found** - Specification is complete and ready for implementation planning.
