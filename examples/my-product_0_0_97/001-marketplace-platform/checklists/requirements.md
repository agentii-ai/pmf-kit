- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Results**: All checklist items pass validation

**Spec Quality Assessment**:
- **Personas**: Well-defined with two primary personas (Kit Creator and Kit User), including detailed pain profiles and quantified evidence
- **JTBD**: Three clear jobs-to-be-done with priorities, current workarounds, frequency, and willingness-to-pay evidence
- **Hero Workflows**: Two well-defined workflows with TTFW targets (<10 min for Workflow 1, <5 min for Workflow 2)
- **Success Metrics**: Comprehensive metrics across activation, engagement, retention, AI-specific, business, and marketplace categories—all quantified with thresholds
- **Risks & Mitigations**: Top 3 PMF risks identified with specific mitigation plans
- **Assumptions**: 5 key assumptions documented with impact levels and validation methods
- **Non-Goals**: Clear scope boundaries defined for MVP
- **Constitution Alignment**: All 10 Agentii-Kit constitution principles explicitly verified

**No Issues Found**: Spec is ready for next phase (`/pmfkit.clarify` or `/pmfkit.plan`)
