## Dependencies & Critical Path

- **Phase 1** must complete before Phase 2 (need validated personas + JTBD)
- **Phase 2** must show successful hero workflow before Phase 3 (otherwise channel testing meaningless)
- **Phase 3** validates go-to-market; informs scaling decisions

**Total Duration**: 11 weeks (4+3+4) for full discovery cycle
**Critical Path Indicator**: Participant recruitment (T1.2, T2.3) drives timeline
